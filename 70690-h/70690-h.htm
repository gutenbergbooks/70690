</div>

<p>WHEREAS, in support of the above Indictment, divers allegations are set forth,
as follows, that is to say:—</p>

<p>The accused, JOHN JASPER, aged 26, is Choirmaster at Cloisterham
Cathedral, otherwise known as “lay precentor.” He lodges over the Gateway of the
Cathedral. For some years he admits he has been in the habit of taking opium, and has
resorted to an Opium Den in the East End of London kept by an elderly woman known
as “Princess Puffer.”</p>

<p>The man of whose murder he stands accused was his nephew, EDWIN DROOD,
in his 21st year, and by profession an Engineer. The Prisoner, who was likewise Trustee
and Guardian of the said Edwin Drood, professed the greatest affection for him, and
on the occasion of his visits to Cloisterham manifested every appearance of joy and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The said Edwin Drood was betrothed to one Rosa Bud, this being in fulfillment of
a contract made by their respective parents (now deceased). Certain formalities in
connection with the confirmation of this engagement, notably the handing of a ring by
Mr. Grewgious, solicitor, Staple Inn, legal adviser to Edwin Drood, were witnessed
by Mr. Grewgious’s clerk, Bazzard. There is evidence to show that they had grown
weary of each other, and wished the Contract to be annulled. On the other hand, Jasper,
the Accused, was admittedly in love with Rosa Bud, and it is alleged was secretly jealous
of his nephew. Miss Bud, on her part, deposes that she not only disliked but “feared”
Jasper and avoided his attentions as much as possible. Eventually the engagement between
Edwin Drood and Rosa Bud was rescinded by mutual consent; but the said John
Jasper, for sufficient reasons, was not at the time warned of this fact. The circumstance,
however, was revealed to Mr. Grewgious.</p>

<p>WITNESSES will be called to prove that in the early part of the year, the Accused,
Jasper, accompanied a stonemason named Durdles to the Cathedral and made particular
enquiry into the destructive qualities of quicklime. It is also alleged that Jasper applied
a drug to this same Durdles, causing sleep, and that he then appropriated his keys, and
therefrom made a close investigation of the vaults, especially of the Sapsea vault,
which was partly hollow.</p>

<p>There were also residing in Cloisterham an orphan brother and sister, twins, by
name Neville and Helena Landless. They came from Ceylon, where they had been
subjected to personal ill-treatment, and after staying with Mr. Honeythunder, their
guardian, Neville was lodged with Canon Crisparkle, and Helena was sent to Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Twinkleton’s school. Neville Landless is described as “fierce” and hot-blooded,
Helena Landless is “almost of the gipsy type.” Between her and her brother is a
strong bond of affection. In her girlhood she had escaped at times from her cruel step-father
by disguising herself as a boy. She is a woman of much daring.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival in Cloisterham, they met Drood, Jasper and Miss Bud at a
party. It will be given in evidence that there was a contention between Drood and Neville,
and that Jasper afterwards fomented the ill-feeling and charged Neville Landless with
being “murderous.” At the same time, Miss Landless was seized with an instinctive
hostility towards Jasper, who, she thought, was unduly menacing Rosa Bud. Matters
between the two young men were smoothed over to some extent, and on the following
Christmas Eve, John Jasper decided to bring them together at a convivial gathering in
his own house.</p>

<p>On December 23rd Jasper visited the Opium Den in London. Next day he returned
to Cloisterham, and was followed thither by the Opium Woman, who had heard him
use threatening language in his sleep towards someone called “Ned” (Jasper’s nickname
for Edwin Drood).</p>

<p>At night (Christmas Eve) the three men met and dined. It was a night of wild storm.
The next morning Jasper hastened to Canon Crisparkle’s house shouting excitedly
that his dear nephew had disappeared, and that he was convinced he had been murdered.</p>

<p>He plainly indicated that he believed the murderer was Neville Landless, in whose
company Drood had left Jasper’s house at midnight; and Neville Landless was apprehended,
but subsequently released for want of evidence.</p>

<p>On December 26th Mr. Grewgious visited Jasper and informed him that the
engagement between Drood and Miss Bud had been broken off. It is in evidence that on
hearing this news for the first time, Jasper “gasped, tore his hair, shrieked” and finally
swooned away.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Canon Crisparkle visiting the Weir on the river, discovered Edwin
Drood’s watch and chain, which had been placed in the timbers; and in a pool below
he found Drood’s scarf-pin.</p>

<p>It is in evidence that the accused, Jasper, after a short interval, renewed his attentions
to Miss Rosa Bud, and exercised so great a terror upon her that she deemed it advisable
to take refuge in London under the supervision of Mr. Grewgious and her friend Miss
Twinkleton. Neville Landless also removed to London, where he was visited by his
sister Helena.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a careful watch was kept upon John Jasper by a “stranger,” known as
Dick Datchery. This person took lodgings opposite Jasper’s house and had him under
close observation. “Datchery” (which is admittedly an assumed name) interviewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
several persons, including Durdles and “Princess Puffer,” and kept a private record in
chalk marks of all facts thus ascertained. In consequence of the suspicions excited by
these circumstances, a warrant was applied for and John Jasper was arrested on a charge
of Wilful Murder.</p>

<p>To this he pleads “NOT GUILTY,” and this is the issue to be tried.</p>

PROSECUTION AND DEFENCE</h2>
</div>

<p>The three formal witnesses (that is to say, Crisparkle and Durdles for the Prosecution
and the Opium Woman for the Defence) shall not in their evidence-in-chief go beyond
the book or make any statements not expressly made therein, but in cross-examination
they may, in response to specific questions, give explanations not expressly contained
in the book.</p>

<p>The two chief witnesses (that is to say, Helena Landless for the Prosecution and
Bazzard for the Defence) shall be free both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination
to make statements not made in the book, provided that they are not
contradicted therein.</p>

<p>All statements made in the book shall be taken to be true and admitted by both
sides, and any statement by a witness contradicting such statements shall be considered
thereby proved to be false.</p>

<p>The said two chief witnesses (and no others) shall be allowed to give hear-say evidence.</p>

<p>The Defence having agreed not to call Edwin Drood, the Prosecution agree not to
comment upon his absence from the witness-box either in speech or cross-examination,
but the Prosecution reserve the right to comment upon the silence of Edwin Drood
subsequent to the murder.</p>

<p>Both sides having agreed not to call Grewgious, it is agreed that neither side shall
comment upon the fact that the other has not called him.</p>

<p>The Defence agree that the legal point that no conviction can take place since no
body has been found, shall be raised only after the retirement of the jury, but the
Defence reserves the right to comment upon the absence of a body as part of the general
absence of direct evidence of the commission of a murder.</p>

<p>Mr. Matz then proceeded to open the case for the prosecution in the following
speech:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury</span>—</p>

<p>The case to be tried is one of murder—murder which we shall contend was premeditated,
pre-arranged and carried out in a methodical and determined manner.</p>

<p>The Prisoner is John Jasper, Lay Precentor at Cloisterham Cathedral. The Prosecution
will set itself to prove that on the night of the 24th December he murdered in that
city his nephew Edwin Drood, an Engineer.</p>

<p>The said Edwin Drood was 21 years of age, and for some years was betrothed to
Miss Rosa Bud in fulfilment of a dying wish of their respective parents (now deceased).</p>

<p>To this young lady the Prisoner acted as music master, and admittedly was enamoured
of her, although he kept this fact secret from Edwin Drood.</p>

<p>On the evening in question—the 24th December—Edwin Drood and Neville Landless—a
pupil of the Revd. Septimus Crisparkle—dined together with the Prisoner in his
rooms in the Gate House adjoining the Cathedral.</p>

<p>The night was a terribly stormy one. After leaving the Prisoner, some time about
midnight, the two young men took a walk to the river to see the effect of the storm on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the water, and returned to the house of the Revd. Septimus Crisparkle in Minor Canon
Corner. Here Edwin Drood left his companion, intending to return to his Uncle’s
lodgings.</p>

<p>Nothing has been heard or seen of him since.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, it is our painful duty to produce evidence to prove that Edwin Drood
was murdered by his Uncle, the Prisoner. We contend that Jasper divested him of his
watch and chain and his scarf pin, articles the Prisoner had, on another occasion, explained
to the local jeweller he knew Drood to possess. The words he used were that
he had “an inventory of them in his mind.”</p>

<p>We contend that Jasper then cast the body of his victim into a vault in the Cathedral
precincts, the key of which, or a duplicate, he had previously become possessed of.
There had also been placed in the vicinity a quantity of quicklime, and we submit that
Jasper, having made some inquiries into its properties, used this for the purpose of
removing all traces of the body in the shortest period of time. We submit that he got rid
of the watch and chain and scarf pin in the river, either in the hope of disposing of
material which the quicklime would not destroy, or to give the impression, should they
be found, that the young man was drowned.</p>

<p>We shall in evidence show that the Prisoner had <em>motive</em> for his crime, that he made
elaborate preparations for its enactment, and that he succeeded in his terrible deed.</p>

<p>The evidence may be circumstantial only. But circumstantial evidence, I submit,
may be extremely strong—as strong indeed as any direct evidence.</p>

<p>We shall show you that all the acts of John Jasper for some time previous to the committal
of his atrocious crime were self-incriminatory. Not merely that, but they exhibit
his mind working out the very means by which that crime was to be committed. <em>After</em> his
terrible deed was accomplished, his actions, to those who observed him closely, also
indicated clearly his guilt.</p>

<p>The Prisoner, having made up his mind that, for his own selfish ends Edwin Drood
must be killed, first chose the spot best suited to his purpose, and laid methodical plans
to secure access to that spot. He paid visits to it in the company of one, Durdles, the
Cloisterham stonemason, whom he drugged with doctored wine whilst there, in order
that he might acquire secretly the key to a certain vault. He knew where quicklime could
be procured without loss of time. He interviewed other persons, and timed the hour
and everything else so thoroughly that nothing essential for his purpose was overlooked.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, it is necessary to refer briefly to some further facts bearing upon
the history of this crime.</p>

<p>Neville Landless, upon whom Jasper cast suspicion of being the murderer, and his
sister Helena, were both students in Cloisterham: the brother, a pupil of the Revd.
Septimus Crisparkle, and the sister a pupil at Miss Twinkleton’s Academy in the city.
They came from Ceylon, where they had been severely ill-treated, and had made several
attempts to escape. On each occasion of the flight Helena “dressed as a boy and showed
the daring of a man.” Neville, a highly strung and emotional youth, took immediate
objection to Drood because of his “air of proprietorship” over Rosa; whilst Helena
instinctively disliked Jasper because she saw that he loved Rosa and that Rosa feared him.
It is worth noting as a significant fact that at the earliest stage Rosa appealed to Helena
for aid and every assistance was promised to her.</p>

<p>A slight quarrel between Edwin Drood and Neville Landless took place in Jasper’s
rooms, and undoubtedly Jasper goaded them on by his taunts. On this occasion Jasper
gave them some mulled wine which had taken him a long time to mix and compound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
They drank to the toast proposed by Jasper and their speech quickly became thick and
indistinct, indicating that there was a sinister design in the mixing and compounding.
Drood became boastful, and Neville Landless resented his tone, and at the height of the
dispute, flung the dregs of his wine at Edwin Drood. Although posing as a Peacemaker
Jasper actually fomented the hostility of these two young men. He seemed to delight in
it and it enabled him subsequently to report to Crisparkle that Neville was “<em>murderous</em>.”
Indeed he went so far as to assert that he “might have laid his dear boy at his feet,
and that it was no fault of his that he did not.”</p>

<p>The Revd. Mr. Crisparkle talked with Helena and Neville on the latter’s rash conduct,
and he expressed extreme regret and promised to exercise more caution in future. On
another occasion Crisparkle visited Jasper, who read to him passages from his diary
expressing fears for Drood’s safety. A few days later Drood, at the suggestion of Jasper,
wrote and agreed to dine with him and Neville on Christmas Eve at the Gate house,
Cloisterham—in order that the two young men should become friends. Their walk
after dinner is evidence that this object was fully achieved.</p>

<p>We submit that, the whole plans having thus been prepared, the murder of Edwin
Drood took place after the parting of the young men, and that John Jasper and no other
was the murderer. In support of this we shall produce evidence to prove that Jasper
acted in a highly incriminatory manner.</p>

<p>The next morning whilst great commotion was raging in the vicinity of the cathedral
over the damage done by the storm, John Jasper broke into the crowd crying: “Where
is my nephew?” as if everybody knew he was missing, whereas no one but the prisoner
had any reason to think he was not in the Prisoner’s rooms. He even volunteered the
statement that Drood had gone “down to the river last night, with <em>Mr. Neville</em>, to look
at the storm, and had not been back?” and demanded that Mr. Neville should be called.</p>

<p>These utterances were made to the Revd. Canon, and showed clearly that the
murderer felt so confident that he had executed his deed with perfect thoroughness
that no fear of discovery need enter his mind. But knowing his nephew was murdered
he tried immediately to fix the deed upon another.</p>

<p>I must direct your attention to one other matter. John Jasper, whether guilty or not
of murder, is indisputably a hypocrite, leading a double life. Like most criminals he was
also capable of foolish mistakes. Had he not killed his “dear boy,” as he called him, he
would have made investigations of his whereabouts, he would have refrained from
courting inquiries, and would not have excited the hostility of Rosa Bud.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, most criminals of the John Jasper type, make at least one error in
the execution of their crime, which ultimately finds them out. Jasper made his. Having
as I have said, divested Edwin Drood of his watch and chain and scarf pin, all the
jewellery he was aware Drood had upon his person, he felt safe. But he left, unknown to
him, on the person of the young man a valuable gold ring set with rubies and diamonds,
and this ring quicklime could not consume. The ring was once the property of Rosa
Bud’s mother and had been handed to Edwin Drood by Mr. Grewgious, Rosa Bud’s
guardian, with strict instructions that he should give it to Rosa if he intended to marry
her, or return it to Mr. Grewgious should Edwin and Rosa decide, as seemed likely, to
break their betrothal.</p>

<p>This was a faithful promise and was witnessed by one, Bazzard, the clerk to the said
Mr. Grewgious.</p>

<p>It so happened that on December 24th the young couple did break off their engagement.
Therefore if Drood, by any chance, were now alive, that ring would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
returned to Mr. Grewgious, in accordance with his promise. But, gentlemen, it never
has been returned, and why? We say because Drood is no longer alive, but dead, and
that where the body was hidden after the murder, there that ring was hidden also.</p>

<p>Jasper knew of all the articles that were on the person of Edwin Drood, except that ring.
He did not know of that because it had only been handed to Drood on the previous day.</p>

<p>Nor did Jasper know of the breaking off of the betrothal, else would there have been
no object in his committing the murder. Evidence will be given that Drood promised
Rosa he would not spoil his Uncle’s Christmas festivities by telling him of their decision
to part as lovers.</p>

<p>The first time Jasper learnt the fact was on the day following the murder, when he
heard it from Mr. Grewgious. He then instantly “gasped, tore his hair, shrieked,”
swooned and “fell a heap of torn and miry clothes upon the floor.” From this we infer
that the information was unexpected and a shock to him.</p>

<p>Sometime afterwards the Revd. Canon Crisparkle found the watch and chain and
scarf pin, when walking near the weir, and he will be called to give evidence on this
and other facts.</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, let me read to you an extract from the diary of Jasper entered
after this discovery. It reads thus—</p>

<p>“My dear boy is murdered. The discovery of the watch and shirt pin convinces
me that he was murdered on that night, and that his jewellery was taken from him to
prevent identification by its means.”</p>

<p>The word “murdered” was frequently in the mind of Jasper at this time, and he
made use of it in several phrases in his diary, which clearly demonstrates that he was
attempting to create the impression that his nephew was murdered, and, by using the
words, hoped to divert attention from himself.</p>

<p>But he became so nervous of what he had written, that he declared to the Revd.
Canon that he meant to “burn this year’s diary at the year’s end” and by so doing,
as he evidently thought, destroy all evidence of his guilty conscience.</p>

<p>There is one more phase to touch upon.</p>

<p>It is admitted that John Jasper was secretly addicted to opium smoking and frequented
a certain opium den in London kept by a person known as the “Princess Puffer.”
Whilst under the influence of opium he babbled strangely, moaned, and uttered significant
words in the hearing of the opium woman. This woman followed him more
than once to Cloisterham and on one of these occasions, the fateful 24th December,
she accosted Edwin Drood, and for the price of three and sixpence offered to tell him
something. He paid her the money and she asked him first his name, and when he told
her Edwin, she wanted to know, “Is the short of that name Eddy?...” Drood answered
“It is sometimes called so.” “You be thankful your name is not <em>Ned</em>,” she next replied,
“because it is a threatened name: a dangerous name.” “Threatened men live long,”
he assured her. Her reply was—</p>

<p>“Then Ned—so threatened is he, wherever he may be while I am a-talking to you,
deary—should live to all eternity!”</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, it is a striking and amazing fact that Jasper, and he only, called
Edwin Drood “Ned”—the threatened name.</p>

<p>That very night Edwin Drood disappeared, and he has “never revisited the light of
the sun.”</p>

<p>A few months passed and no trace of the body of the ill-fated young man having
been found, Jasper, feeling he had cleared his way effectively, called at the Nun’s House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
(Miss Twinkleton’s Academy) one afternoon in the vacation, and taking Rosa unawares
made passionate love to her. On being repulsed he vowed vengeance on Neville Landless—the
man against whom he had already directed suspicion. So horrified was Rosa, she
flew for safety to her guardian Mr. Grewgious at Staple Inn. A strict watch was kept
upon Jasper by a person calling himself Mr. Datchery, with the result that he was
eventually arrested.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, that is the case put to you as briefly as possible—it is the case you
have to try.</p>

<p>We feel confident that the evidence we shall place before you will convince you
that the prisoner has committed a foul crime, and that we can safely leave the issue
to you. Painful as your duty may be, we look to you to give your verdict faithfully and
fearlessly in the interests of justice and your fellow-men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: But for that purpose you must examine the prisoner in chief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I think, my Lord, that you will find a conversation took place between
Durdles and the prisoner, and that I am perfectly justified in asking what the conversation
was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: Yes; I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span> (<em>to witness</em>): Let us know what the conversation was between you

“Anything new! Anything old, you mean.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What happened then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: We went down in the crypt, and he give me a drink out of his bottle.
Fine stuff it was, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And what about that bundle which I believe you carried?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He asked me if he could carry my bundle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Ay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What was in your bundle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Durdles knows what was in his bundle. Keys, among other things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Oh, keys. And I suppose you let him carry your bundle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did. Well, I had another drink out of his bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you happen on that occasion to see any quicklime lying about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, there’s always quicklime lying about the crypt. Always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You noticed it. Did Jasper happen to notice it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He did. He asked me what it was for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Oh, he asked you what it was for. And did you tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; I told him it ’ud burn anything; burn your boots, and with a
little handy stirring, it ’ud burn your bones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It would burn your bones with handy stirring. And when he put
that curious question to you, did it occur to you there was a reason for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Durdles thinks everybody ’as a reason for everything they says and does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: When he asked you would that quicklime burn, you thought he
must have a reason for it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; so I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: People use quicklime for quite innocent purposes, I believe, don’t they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: They use it for cement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What else do they use it for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Bodies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you think, by the way he was making his inquiries, that he
wanted to know if it would burn something else besides ordinary stuff?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I didn’t think as ’ow he wanted a heap of quicklime to burn his waste
paper with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What happened next? You had a drink out of the bottle, and you
had a little talk: what happened then? Did you go home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Oh, you fell asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You had a dream before you woke up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What was the nature of that dream?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I dreamt that Mister Jarsper was a-moving around me, handling my keys,
and I thought I was left alone in the dark. Then I see a light coming back, and then
I found Mr. Jarsper waking me up, saying “Hi! wake up!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you wake up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you remember how long you had been asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A long time. I remember the clock struck two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you went in about midnight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You had two hours’ sleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Anything else? Did you notice anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: When I woke up, I sees my key on the ground, and I says, “I dropped
you, did I?” So I picks it up, and asks Mister Jarsper for my bundle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he give it to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I think you had on that occasion a little conversation about a curious
art of yours—tapping the tombs?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; oh, yes—yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Would you mind telling the court?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I told him, with my little hammer I could tap and go on tapping, and I
could tell whether anything was solid or whether it was hollow. For instance, I says,
“Tap, tap, old ’un crumbled up in stone coffin in the vault!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That’s what you said, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And what did Mr. Jasper say to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He said it was wonderful, and I says, “No; I ain’t going to take it as a
gift, ’cause it’s all out o’ my own head.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I understand you told him what you could do by tapping the walls—tell
whether it was hollow or solid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, Durdles can tell whether it’s hollow or solid by its tap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was he interested in your conversation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Very much, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you happen to notice the Sapsea tomb?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Durdles knows the Sapsea tomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: There is only one body in that tomb at present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you tap the Sapsea tomb with your hammer, and did it sound
surprising there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It sounded more solid than usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Since then, you have tapped it lately, and it sounds a little more solid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: This is contrary to an understanding. This is a formal witness,
not to be cross-examined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Very well, I will go on. (<em>To witness.</em>) Did you meet him at another time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: This is only formal evidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: What is the point?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You will find before you, my Lord, a document, and you will
find there that certain witnesses who are to be cross-examined at length will be free to
go beyond certain admitted evidence. The formal witnesses are not to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span> (<em>after perusing the “Conditions”</em>): Yes, I think I take your point, Mr.
Chesterman—or Chesterton—whatever it is. The point, I understand, is that you are
cross-examining this witness as if he were a principal witness of the trial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: In the second paragraph I think you will notice——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It is not of great importance to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: One moment: I will see. (<em>After reading the paragraph referred to.</em>) I think
you are justified up to the point to which you have gone, but I should recommend you
to terminate it with some rapidity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I only want to ask one question. (<em>To witness.</em>) You did have a conversation
with Mr. Datchery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I ask you to say, my Lord, that the Jury must entirely disregard
the statement about the tapping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: How are we to dismiss it from our minds, my Lord? It is a very
difficult point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I think I shall leave the Jury to draw their own conclusions. All I
want to know from Durdles is, did he have a conversation with Datchery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Thank you. That is all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Thank you, sir. I’ll drink your health on the way home, p’raps twice, and
I won’t go home till morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Oh, beg pardon, sir, beg pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Now, Durdles, you know all about the destructive qualities of quicklime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Do you say that quicklime will not destroy metals?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I don’t think quicklime will destroy metals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You don’t think it will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I knows it won’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Now, Durdles——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I must ask you to address the witness in more respectful terms, such as
“Mr.” Durdles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Very well, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: <em>Mister</em> Durdles, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span> (<em>to witness</em>): I understand you were employed round about the Cathedral,
and that you know all about the crypt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Now, tell me what was the state of the windows in 1860.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Ay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: I put it to you again. In what state were the windows of the crypt in
1860?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Do you mean clean or dirty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: I put it to you they were in a very broken condition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, sir; always broken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: As a matter of fact, they were not only broken, weren’t they, but
partially boarded up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, I can’t remember, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Can’t remember! You were constantly in the crypt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Some of ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: How many windows are there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I don’t suppose the witness is expected to count windows!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Well, now, Mr. Durdles, I will ask you another question. As a matter
of fact, have you not on many occasions chased little boys and others out of the crypt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, and they’ve chased me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Where did these boys find their way into the crypt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Ay?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You don’t know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You swear you don’t know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Ay, I swear I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You have never seen them creeping through the windows of the crypt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Might be; when I’ve been sober.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: That’ll do. Now, you tell us that you met Mr. Datchery. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Have you ever admitted Mr. Datchery to the Sapsea vault?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: This is going far beyond—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: If my learned friend will look at the first paragraph he will see
that in cross-examination the formal witnesses may, in response to specific questions,
give explanations not expressly contained in the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Then I must re-examine the witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Now, Mr. Durdles, have you ever admitted Mr. Datchery to the
Sapsea vault?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Not that I can remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: If you cannot remember admitting Datchery, do you at any time
remember admitting anybody else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I can’t say as I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Thank you, Mr. Durdles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: The Reverend Canon Crisparkle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Usher</span>: Reverend Canon Crisparkle.</p>

<p>[That gentleman responded to the call, and entering the witness box, was duly sworn.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: May I interpose for a moment? This gentleman has been called as the
Reverend Septimus Crisparkle. I submit to your Lordship that his real name is Christopher
Nubbles, a man who was tried before you on the information of a certain Mr.
Chuckster, on the charge of being a snob, and you, in one of those summings-up which
have made your name famous wherever the English language is spoken, found that
the charge brought by Mr. Chuckster was well and truly proved. Now, I contend that
Mr. Christopher Nubbles has gone to Cloisterham, become a Minor Canon, taken the
name of Crisparkle, and is here obviously a more intolerable snob than ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Mr. Crisparkle; I believe you are a Minor Canon of Cloisterham
Cathedral?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I believe your identity has never been disputed until this moment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Never. I am glad to be able to answer that impertinent reflection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you happen to know John Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Very well. He was associated with me daily in the duties of the Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he ever tell you about his affection for his nephew, Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Constantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And did he, while in this confidential mood, also tell you of his
great affection for Miss Rosa Bud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I cannot charge my memory that he ever mentioned affection for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Well, then, in that matter John Jasper deceived you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, shall we say deceived? Guilty of a lapse of confidence to a priest.
Theologically speaking it would be deceit, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I believe, Mr. Crisparkle, that you have been acting as tutor to
Neville Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you mind telling the court the opinion you formed of that man’s
character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should say a very impulsive man, but responsive to influence of any kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I think he has a sister?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Oh, yes: Miss Helena Landless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Is he under her influence at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, I should say she exercises a good and strong influence upon him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I should suggest that question is very improper. We are all under the
influence of each other to a great extent. I am as much under the influence of the
foreman of the Jury that I almost entirely agree with the view that he takes of the
situation when he mentions it. But I think it is not quite proper to say “Is he under
the influence of his sister?” Surely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But, my Lord, this gentleman knows both parties, and is perfectly
acquainted with their relationships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I will not press the point. I will ask you, Mr. Crisparkle, have you
any influence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Is that proper, my Lord?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: Quite proper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should say I have done my best. I have talked to him from time to time
and found him very anxious to profit by any words I was able to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You said he was impetuous. Perhaps he has one or two little faults
of that sort. Would you regard them as dangerous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, no; oh no. The faults of an undisciplined boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Has he any good qualities?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Many, which appear to me to far outweigh the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Suppose Neville Landless had a little quarrel with another young
man. Would you attach much importance to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I think not: very little, I think. Hot-tempered youth—soon over.
He would be the first to regret it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you know Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you heard of a quarrel between him and Neville Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Who told you about that quarrel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, in the first instance, Neville Landless mentioned it to me when
he came back to my house. He said he had made a bad beginning and was sorry. But
immediately afterwards John Jasper came to the house, and gave me what I am bound
to say was a very different account indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: This is the John Jasper who had already deceived you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Who had perhaps misled me by suppression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He was the John Jasper who was Edwin Drood’s rival for Rosa Bud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It would appear so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You say he gave a strong account of the quarrel—Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It is more than correct. He said, when he came into the room, that he had
had an awful time with him. I said, “Surely not as bad as that!” and he said “Murderous—murderous!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Are you sure he used the word “Murderous”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am absolutely certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did you say to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I said, “I must beg you not to use quite such strong language.” He
continued to use even stronger terms. He said there was something tigerish in Neville’s
blood. He was afraid he would have struck his dear boy, as he called him, down at his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You are quite sure those were his words?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Absolutely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And I suppose, following on that, you asked for an explanation from
Neville? Did you have any conversation with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, a long conversation with him in company with his sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was Jasper satisfied with the explanation given to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I’m afraid not. A few days afterwards, when I was endeavouring to
make peace between the two combatants, and arranged a meeting, Jasper took the
opportunity to show me his diary, in which he had written his fears and suspicions in
regard to his dear boy’s safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Fears and suspicions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That was the phrase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: May we take it then, that this man was always harping on danger
and using the word “Murder,” and influencing your mind against Neville Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am afraid that was the impression which I derived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was that the impression left in your mind after the conversation
with John Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I think you know that on the Christmas Eve following, there was
a friendly little party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; I was instrumental in arranging it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Following on that, Neville Landless was, on the following day, to
start on a walking expedition?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he tell you all about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He was quite frank?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Quite frank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he start to carry out his plans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He started.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: On the Christmas morning, early?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you remember that Christmas Eve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Perfectly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Especially because of the beauty of Evensong that day. John Jasper was
in splendid voice that day, and I congratulated him when he came out of the Cathedral.
I said he must be in very good health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Very good health: did he say anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He said he <em>was</em> in very good health, and that the black humours were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
passing from him, and that he would have to burn his diary—consign it to the flames—that
was the phrase.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He also laughed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He went laughing up the postern gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you mind telling us whether laughing was common with John
Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: In short, you thought it an exceptional piece of good humour?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; he made that impression on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you remember what sort of night it was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A terrible night of storm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Let us get on to the next morning. The next morning what
happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Before I was about, while I was still in my dressing room, I was aware
of a great noise at my gate, and there I saw John Jasper, insufficiently attired, crying
very loudly to me in the house. I looked out, and asked what was the matter, and he
said, “Where is my nephew?” Naturally, I said to him, “Why should you ask me?”
and he said, “Last evening, very late, he went down to the river to see the storm, in
company with Mr. Neville Landless,” since when nothing had been heard of him.
And then he said, “Call Mr. Neville.” I told him Neville had already started.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: When this conversation took place between you and John Jasper,
did it occur to you that he was dazed, as if suffering from the effect of drugs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did it strike you that he was particularly clear-headed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think so. Yes: he was very clear-headed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was he concise and clear in his remarks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, perfectly clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: If anybody told you he was suffering from the effect of drugs, or was
dazed or bewildered, would your observation bear that out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did you do in respect of Mr. Neville?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: We sent some men after him, and Mr. Jasper and I followed. Directly
we came up with him, Jasper said, “Where is my nephew?” and Neville said, “Why
do you ask me?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did Jasper say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He said, “He was last seen in your company”—or words to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: When he said that, what sort of impression did it cause on you?
What did you think it meant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am sorry to say I had the unpleasant impression that he meant to
suggest that Neville Landless was in some way responsible for Drood’s disappearance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Once more he was suggesting murder?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, that was the impression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And once more suggesting that Neville Landless was the murderer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That was so, undoubtedly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: This man, Neville Landless, with this terrible charge hanging over
him; did he come back readily?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he answer any questions put to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Quite frankly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Some time afterwards, you made a discovery, I think. Would you
mind telling the Court what it was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I was walking along by the river, some two miles above where these
young men had gone for their walk—by the weir, in fact,—when I saw something shining
brightly. Looking more closely, I thought it was a jewel. I immediately dived in, being
fortunately a good swimmer, and found that it was a gold watch and chain. The chain was
hanging on the timbers. Later I found in the mud a gold scarf-pin. The watch had the
initials E. D. engraved on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you tell Jasper you had discovered these things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: At once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he say anything about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Nothing at the time, but a few days later, when we were disrobing in the
vestry, he showed me the diary to which I have alluded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did it contain any reference to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I cannot charge my memory with the exact words, but something to
this effect—“My poor boy is certainly murdered. The discovery of the watch and scarf-pin
leaves that beyond doubt. They were no doubt thrown away to prevent identification
of the body”—or words to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: One moment, Mr. Crisparkle. Am I right in saying that once more
Murder was suggested to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And that Neville Landless was pointed to as the murderer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And so that would be the impression left on your mind by your
conversation with Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Whether it was right or wrong, that would be the impression left?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Whether right or wrong, that would undoubtedly be the impression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Thank you, Mr. Crisparkle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: May I ask one question, my Lord?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: Do I understand the witness to say that the prisoner was a musician?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foreman</span>: His case looks black indeed.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Canon Crisparkle Cross-examined.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Canon Crisparkle, you referred to the night of the preliminary quarrel
and the return of Neville Landless. Do you remember accusing Neville of intoxication?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Quite well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You said, “You are not sober”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Do you remember his reply?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He said, “Yes; I am afraid that is true, although I took very little to drink.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: “Although I can satisfy you at another time that I had very little to
drink.” I put it, those were the words he used?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Doubtless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You said you went down to the weir, which is two miles from the
river?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; two miles from the point at which Edwin Drood and Neville Landless
went down to watch the storm. It is two miles higher up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: And it was there you found the articles you have described?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: What was the position of the watch and chain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It was adhering to the timbers. Where two timbers crossed, it had
become fixed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: As though somebody had gone down with a hammer and nail and
hung it up deliberately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, that I would not say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Was the pin in the mud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In the mud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: This was ordinary loose mud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, a kind of sludge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you find anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Nothing else at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Now, Canon Crisparkle, I have just one question of some delicacy
to ask. I hope you won’t be offended. Is it not a fact that you are in love with Helena
Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: My lord, my lord, I must object. I think this is a secret to a man’s
breast, and my friend has no right to try to get it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: My Lord, I have no objection to answer the question. The lady will appear
before you shortly, and when you see her you will not be surprised that my heart is a
little affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Thank you, Canon Crisparkle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Canon Crisparkle, one word please, as to the exact position of the
weir. I think you have not been carefully examining the exact position lately? You could
not testify whether it was two miles, one mile, or one and a half miles, and would not
commit yourself to an actual distance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; we are not in mathematics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: If I told you it was a little nearer the Cathedral, you would not
dispute it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Not for a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Thank you, Canon Crisparkle. That will do.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Evidence of Helena Landless.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Call Helena Landless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Usher</span>: Helena Landless!</p>

<p>[That lady was conducted to the witness-box, and duly sworn.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What is your name, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Helena Landless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you have a brother named Neville?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; a twin brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Is there a great bond of sympathy between you and your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A very great bond.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Is it so strong that you have an intimate understanding of each other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: We almost know each other’s thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And I think you are accustomed to exercise influence on him—perhaps
to lead him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It always has been so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Where did you live when young?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In Ceylon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: With your parents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No. My parents died when we were young, and a step-father brought us up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: How did he treat you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Very badly indeed. He was always cruel and harsh to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Ever beat you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: We were whipped like dogs, and we ran away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: How old were you when you first ran away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Seven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Who suggested running away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And did your brother follow you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He always followed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You planned everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I always planned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Weren’t you afraid to run away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I was afraid of nothing to be free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did you do in order to make a flight successful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I cut off my hair, and dressed myself as a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That needed a great amount of daring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, the occasion needed all the daring I could command.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And when it needs all the daring you can command, you don’t mind
daring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: As a matter of fact, you did it, I think, not only for yourself, but
for your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think more for him than for myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you love your brother very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Dearly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Still?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Would you do as much again, Miss Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I would; and more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: As much for anybody else you love?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: If I loved them dearly enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You have lately come to England. When you came, tell us where
you resided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I went to Miss Twinkleton’s at the Nun’s House, and my brother went
to Mr. Crisparkle’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I believe the Nun’s House is an Academy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Other girls there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, several.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Miss Rosa Bud there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Ever meet her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Ever become friends with her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; very great friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you form an estimate of her character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I thought she was a sweet, lovable girl, but shy and timid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Not got your daring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: She was learning music, I think? Who was her tutor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: John Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you remember a party at Canon Crisparkle’s shortly after your
arrival?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: On the night of our arrival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Who was there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Myself, Miss Twinkleton, and Rosa Bud, and Edwin Drood, and John
Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You are sure John Jasper was there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; I noticed him particularly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Because of his strange manner towards Rosa Bud.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He watched her closely. During the evening she sang to his accompaniment,
and his eyes were fixed on her the whole time with a most peculiar expression,
and this seemed to trouble Rosa, although she was not looking at him. Suddenly she
covered her face with her hands, burst into tears, and said she was frightened and wanted
to be taken away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You don’t think it was pure imagination on her part? She was
frightened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: When people are frightened there is danger about generally. Did you
think there was any danger in his looking at her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I thought there was danger in his looks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you ever speak to her about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes. She said she was terrified at him; that he haunted her like a ghost,
and that he made secret love to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And she didn’t like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: She begged me to take care of her, and stay with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you promise to do so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I said I would protect her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Be very careful. If this man frightened her, would he not equally
frighten you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In no circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That is because you are a woman of daring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: If you promised to shield and protect her, you did not content
yourself with words. Did you take any action?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I kept a sort of watch on John Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Why on Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Because I felt that he menaced Rosa’s peace and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You thought he was the source of the danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No one but Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Had she any enemies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; she was too sweet and lovable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you thought it was John Jasper, and John Jasper alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: We will leave that for a moment, and come to your brother. You are
very intimate with your brother, and he confides in you. Were he and Drood friendly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, but they had a little misunderstanding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Misunderstanding?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Only a difference of opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you think it would lead your brother to make an attack on him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The idea is preposterous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: They had a quarrel at the outset?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: My brother did not like the way in which Edwin Drood spoke of Rosa
Bud. He thought he was too patronising. John Jasper came up, made a great deal more
of it than it warranted, and then insisted on the young men going back with him to
have a glass of wine—stirrup-cup, he called it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What was the effect on your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Both became flushed and excited.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was it very usual with your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Yet a small quantity had this effect on him. Did you suspect anything
of the wine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am morally certain the wine was drugged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I believe after that there was to be a little patching up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That was owing to Canon Crisparkle. They were all to meet and shake hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was it to be a large party, or confined to themselves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Only my brother and Edwin Drood and John Jasper, who had invited
them to his house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That was on the Christmas Eve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you know anything about your brother’s plans for the next day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He had planned to go on a walking tour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You knew all about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: All arranged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: No secret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And to the best of your knowledge, he started on that tour next
morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Now, to get back to the party: you saw your brother just before
he went?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was he happy and jolly going to the party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No. He was ready to shake hands with Edwin Drood, but he had a
strange dread of the gatehouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He did not object to going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; because he wanted to shake hands with Edwin Drood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Then the main object of his going was, not to enjoy himself, but to
shake hands with Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you think that was practically the only motive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: We are told that Neville was fetched back after starting on his journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was it a surprise he was fetched back after Drood’s extraordinary
disappearance was mentioned?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But when you heard who had fetched him back, was that a surprise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; because Jasper had always been his enemy from the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You thought he had cast suspicion on him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Jasper had hinted in Cloisterham to many people that if anything ever
happened to his nephew my brother would be responsible for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And so you knew that your brother was under deep suspicion when
brought back to Cloisterham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you take that very much to heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did, indeed, seeing it concerned the one I loved best in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: There were two persons you wanted to protect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Who were they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: My brother, and Rosa Bud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You had a double motive, and you thought the danger came from
one and the same man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I certainly did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Who was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: John Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did your brother do after all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was so sad and unhappy that he left Cloisterham, and took lodgings
in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You went with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I stopped there to live it down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That is where your courage came in again?—But you need not
reply. I shall leave it to the Jury to draw their own conclusions. And now, all this time
you were watching Jasper? Did you discover anything about his actions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Nothing definite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you hear of his going here and there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; there were periodical disappearances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you know where he went on those occasions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, he went to London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And when in Cloisterham, how did he behave?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He went about always throwing out hints that he had thought my brother
so hot tempered that he was afraid for his nephew to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he meet Rosa Bud again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He made love to her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did she receive him kindly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Hated him, loathed him, was terrified at him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he say anything to her when he discovered what her attitude
was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He told her that nothing should prevent him from having her himself.
No one should stand against him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he threaten anyone who did stand against him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; he threatened my brother’s life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You mean, he said to Rosa Bud something which amounted to a
threat against your brother’s life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He said he could place him in the greatest jeopardy and danger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Then you thought his danger would increase?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I suppose you went to London occasionally to see your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Not often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you ever see Rosa Bud in London?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes. She fled to London, so terrified was she at Jasper with his desperate
love-making. She went to Mr. Grewgious, her guardian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you determined to shield her as much as possible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: More than ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you ever recall those words, that you would not, in any circumstances,
be afraid of Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Not a mere idle boast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You meant it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Six months went by, and no progress made?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I found out nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Yet the danger remained, and increased?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I grew more and more anxious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It was the woman against the man, and the woman was making no
headway?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you think it was about time to change your course of
action?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I remembered how, as a little girl, I dressed myself as a boy, and now
I determined to dress myself as a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That was the result of recalling what you had done as a girl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What you had done in the past you could do again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It was difficult, you realised?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, it was difficult, but I determined to overcome every difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You did not shrink?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Naturally I shrank, but the end was worth all the sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You determined to go through with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Because you had this double motive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: The overpowering motive which overcame everything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Very well, now; if you could have avoided dressing yourself as a
man, if some other course had been open to you, would you have taken it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: If I could have felt sure of success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But you felt this was the last resource, and determined to do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: In order to appear as a man, you had to adopt a very complete
disguise indeed. Did you remember what you did when you were a little girl? Did you
cut off your hair again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I thought I could manage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Miss Landless, I don’t want to press you, but was there any particular,
personal reason why you didn’t wish to sacrifice your hair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Am I obliged to answer that question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: His Lordship says you need not answer that question. I think we
may leave it to the Jury, as human beings, to give their own answer. But, at all
events, we understand that you did not cut off your hair. Did you whiten your
eyebrows?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You thought you could manage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: How did you disguise yourself effectively?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I put on a large wig of white hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: To conceal your own luxuriant tresses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I bound them well down underneath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I thought, in keeping with a large head of white hair, I had better assume
the free and easy manners of an elderly man, and I tried to put a little dash of swagger,
and I wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It was not so difficult, after all, in some respects, for you are a rapid
and fluent talker—you need not be shy, you are—and therefore, as Dick Datchery, the
affable old gentleman, a bit garrulous, you did not find much difficulty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No: I did not find it very difficult.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did you do in Cloisterham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I put up at the Crozier Inn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Where is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In the High Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Far from the Gate House?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you try the effect of your disguise on the people in the neighbourhood?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, at the Crozier I walked in, asked a few questions, and ordered a
man’s dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You ordered a man’s dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: You would not have had me ask for a glass of milk and a Sally Lunn!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: What is a man’s dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I called for a fried sole, and a veal cutlet, and a pint of sherry. Something
like a man’s dinner!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And did you consume this gargantuan feast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think you are an intelligent gentleman, and I will leave it to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You may. Now let us come to your inquiries. I suppose you wanted
lodgings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I asked the waiter if he could direct me to any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I asked for something old, architectural, and inconvenient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And he directed you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Very far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; not far: Mrs. Tope’s house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you find it easily?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No. That would not have done. I wandered about a bit in the wrong
direction, and inquired, and at last found it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: The reason for all that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I wanted to put everybody off the scent, and tried to act as to the manner
born, so that if anybody were watching me they would really take me for the man I
wanted to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You thought it best to take every precaution, in case you were
watched?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And they would think you had lost your way, and were a stranger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: As a matter of fact, you were not a stranger. Did you meet Mr.
Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I made an excuse, and I went up and asked him if he could tell me anything
as to the respectability of the Tope family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: So that you bearded the lion in his den. Did he recognise you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; he did not know the mouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: There are other ways of detecting people than by appearance.
Jasper is a musician with a very delicate ear. What about your voice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Mr. Jasper had only heard it once, and that was months ago, and, besides,
I can change it (<em>changing her voice</em>)—change the tone of my voice, and speak like a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You can disguise it, Miss Landless, so that people would really
think it was a man’s voice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Tell us what you discovered as to Mr. Jasper’s movements at this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He absented himself from the Cathedral every now and then, and made
periodical disappearances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Where did he go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: To London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Were you in correspondence with Mr. Grewgious, the family
solicitor, in London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did he tell you he had seen Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: So that, between you, you knew all about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: In the character of Datchery, did you meet people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Durdles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: The old opium woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Mr. Sapsea, the Mayor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you talk to them familiarly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes. I really knew their idiosyncrasies—everyone of them—so I fooled
them to the top of their bent, and got everything out of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I have no doubt but that you asked the old opium woman some questions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: She had been following Jasper to the Gate House, and she asked me, in
a whisper, would I mind telling her who he was, his name, and where he lived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you said it was John Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes. She asked, would I give her three-and-sixpence to buy some opium.
She said that on Christmas Eve a young gentleman gave her three-and-sixpence, and he
said that his name was Edwin. And she said where could she see Jasper? And I
told her in the Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did she go to the Cathedral next morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; I saw her behind a pillar, shaking her fist at him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You think she knew something about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; that she knew more about his character than anybody else suspected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: May I take it that the results of your investigations led you to the
conclusions about John Jasper—that they increased your suspicions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had my suspicions from the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you keep a record of your successes at the time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In chalk marks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Why in chalk marks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I like the old tavern way of keeping scores. You may make a little mark,
and nobody but the scorer knows what it means: a small mark for a small success,
and a big mark for a big one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Was another reason that you did not wish your woman’s handwriting
to be discovered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That would never have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you adopt any device to bring Jasper into your presence, or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; Mr. Grewgious had told me that he had given a ring to Edwin Drood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And did you use that ring in any way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; it was this ring that I used to lure him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And then, when you confronted Jasper, you felt that you had
sufficient to go upon to accuse him openly of murder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did. His appearance and agitation were sufficient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And so he was accused of murder; and your motives throughout
were disinterested motives for the protection of Rosa Bud and your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You knew Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you think that if he had voluntarily disappeared while all this
trouble was going on, he would have communicated with his friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, he was a kind-hearted lad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You cannot understand him being silent while Rosa was in danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am sure he would not be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You think that, wherever he was, he would have spoken, if alive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Thank you, that will do.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Helena Landless Cross-examined.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Miss Landless, you say you knew the prisoner to some extent
before the disappearance of Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When did you learn that the prisoner was addicted to opium
smoking—or have you learned it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Mr. Tope told me of a seizure he had in the Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When was that, approximately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: As far as I can remember, about a few weeks after I came to Cloisterham
as Dick Datchery. Rosa told me how frightened she was of him after he had had a dream;
that he used to go into a peculiar kind of dream, and a film came over his eyes, and then
she was more terrified of him than before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But you are putting two very different dates. I want to know
when you realised he was addicted to opium smoking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It takes a little time to realise anything. We hear this and that, and we
put two and two together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When Rosa gave you that information, did you suspect
opium smoking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had a faint suspicion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: It occurred to you that it was probably opium. You knew Edwin
Drood, Miss Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Was he a conspicuous person—a person to notice very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Not very much, with the exception of this: that he was rather patronising,
and had the air of a lad who was very much at home with himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He dressed like ordinary young men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Wore trousers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, certainly, I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you understand that the ring was found in the quicklime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I believe so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Oh! you believe so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It was found there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Were any buttons found there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I believe not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I suppose Mr. Drood would presumably have on either a belt
or braces. Was a buckle or a belt or braces found in the quicklime?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Nothing was found in the lime except this ring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I could throw some light on that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your Counsel will no doubt re-examine you. Now, I want to
know about this disguise of yours. You told us that it was no new thing to disguise yourself,
because you dressed up as a boy in Ceylon. Would you kindly tell me how old you
were the last time you did it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Thirteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you really suggest that a little girl of thirteen dressing up
as a little boy—dressing up as a boy of thirteen—is any sort of qualification for a young
lady of 21 dressing up as an “old buffer living idly on his means”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; the girl is mother to the woman, as the boy is father to the man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Well, now, you have told us, Miss Landless, that in dressing up
as Datchery, you wore a white wig, blue coat, buff waistcoat, and so on. Did you do
anything to your face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You did not paint your face at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I always have enough colour in my face without paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You did not make up your face in any way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you ask the Jury to believe that you had been going about
Cloisterham as Helena Landless for more than six months—ever since you came to
Canon Crisparkle’s—that you had been going about as Miss Helena Landless; that
you did not alter your face in any way, and went about as Dick Datchery, seeing the
same people? Do you ask the Jury to believe that you were not recognised?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I ask them to believe it, because it is the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Very well; the Jury will decide that for themselves. You say
you went to Cloisterham and put up at the Crozier?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You also told us that you ordered a certain meal—a fried sole,
a veal cutlet, and a pint of sherry. When my learned friend asked you, you said you
would leave it to us. I must ask you: did you consume that meal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am a healthy young woman, but I did not eat it all. I had a little of the
fish, some of the cutlet, and some of the sherry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: How much sherry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had a glass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: It is important to insist whether the glasses were ordinary wine glasses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Juryman</span> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwin Pugh</span>): I think it is not a fair question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: Any question is fair that tends to bring out the truth. We have no reason
to suppose that all the people in the Court are not lying—nay, even are not supporting
fictitious characters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Juryman</span>: But a sherry glass might be a tumbler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Miss Landless, I press you. You say you only drank one glass.
The remainder of the pint you left in the bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did not say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: If I must say, there were receptacles in the room used by smokers. Some
went that way, some I left in the bottle, and some I drank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Were not people present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Not all the time. Only part of the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: They retired simultaneously?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; there were not many there when I went in. Some left at once;
some finished their dinners and went away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And the fortunate moment arrived when you could pour out
the sherry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: There are such things as fortunate moments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your taste in food and drink interests me a little. I shall return
to the Crozier. But later on, when staying at Tope’s, you used to have an evening meal
prepared for you, consisting of bread and cheese and salad and ale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Was that the sort of meal you were accustomed to at Miss
Twinkleton’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: But, you see, I was not at Miss Twinkleton’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But there would not have been anything eccentric about coffee or tea?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think it would be a very feminine beverage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Very well. You told my learned friend that you did not really
lose your way from the Crozier to Tope’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: The truth of your story you are prepared to stake on that being so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Will the Jury look at page 191 of the book?<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There it states
“he soon became bewildered, and went boggling about and about the Cathedral tower,
whenever he could catch a glimpse of it....” (<em>To the witness.</em>) You could catch a
glimpse of it when you liked?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: There was no question of catching a glimpse of it. You could go
straight to it if you wanted to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: If you are quoting from the book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: We are quoting from something that is admitted as evidence.
Every statement made here must be taken as being true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: But that was a blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I want to carry you further, Miss Landless—“with a general
impression on his mind that Mrs. Tope’s was somewhere very near it.” Is that the
general impression on your mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I knew exactly where to go to Mrs. Tope’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And this “general impression on your mind” goes on—“and
that, like the children in the game of hot boiled beans and very good butter, he was warm
in his search when he saw the tower, and cold when he didn’t see it.” Is not that a
definite statement as to the condition of your mind, and not as to your external actions,
and does it not assert that you did not know where Tope’s lodgings were?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I take it as a blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I draw the attention of the Court to the fact that the conditions of anybody’s
frame of mind have been paid perhaps too little attention to, and if Miss Landless
chooses to say that the original literary person from whom I believe we procured most
of this information was not quite accurate, one can only say she has probably gone
outside the rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: My Lord, I would direct your attention to the third paragraph
of the “Conditions.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span> (<em>after perusing the paragraph referred to</em>): Yes, I see: that is, on the face
of it, it is quite clear that a statement does appear to be made to that effect. The rest
falls into the deplorable abyss of literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span> (<em>to witness</em>): Now, after you had been “boggling about” in search
of a place which you knew perfectly well already, you met a small boy, I think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I need not trouble you with the conversation, but that boy agreed
to conduct you to Tope’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Now he brought you to a place from which the arched passage
was visible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And you said, “That’s Tope’s”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And he answered, “Yer lie; it ain’t. That’s Jarsper’s.” Is
that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And you said, “Indeed?” And you gave a “second look, of
some interest.” What was the meaning of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, of course, I knew it was Jasper’s, but when Jasper’s house or anything
connected with him, was brought to my mind, I always thought it was interesting,
and gave a look for that reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But you knew you were going to Jasper’s house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But why did you give it a second look?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Because I was so interested.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You knew it was Jasper’s, because the boy said it was Jasper’s,
and you gave it “a look of some interest”!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: We know that dinner is ready, but we look with interest at it before we
sit down to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You knew it was Jasper’s, and gave “a second look of some interest”
when told it was Jasper’s. Now you went to Tope’s, and you met, as you told us,
Jasper and Mr. Sapsea, and other people. Now you kept your record, you told us, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
chalk, and you told us that one of your reasons for doing that was that you must evade
discovery of your handwriting?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Had it not been for the fact that you were a woman, I take it
you ask us to believe that you would have written up in ordinary writing all that you
thought and speculated about Jasper on the cupboard door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I do not ask you to believe anything of the kind, for I should not have
been so foolish. I could have written some words if I had wished to, but I would not
write at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You used the old tavern way of keeping scores. Where did you
learn that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In Ceylon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What is the Cingalese tavern way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have not been brought up in a drawing-room, but among a very rough
set of people. My step-father was a low, common man, and frequented taverns, and we
children could go inside and outside or anywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Are there taverns in Ceylon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know that they call them taverns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you suggest that the phrase “old tavern way of keeping
scores” refers to Ceylon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: My chalk marks revert to the time when I was there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: How did you keep scores in Ceylon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did not keep scores there, but I saw other people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: How do you know how they were kept?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did not say I did know exactly, but I learned that a little mark meant a
certain quantity, a bigger mark more, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You like the old tavern way of keeping scores, but do not know
how it is done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I know that a man that had quarts had large strokes, and a man that had
pints smaller ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You swear that was done in Ceylon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I swear that sort of thing was done there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What sort of drinks do they have there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I never had their drinks. I saw them drinking, but I did not know what
it was. But I saw the scores being kept on the back of the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you know what they were drinking at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I took it for spirits, and beer, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: So you knew little about the drinking, but a great deal about
the scoring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That interested me as a child. My brother and I used to talk about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What was the purpose of the scores?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The tavern keepers would do it to know what was due from Tom Scott,
or Jim Price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You told us that you undertook the Datchery impersonation,
so to speak, in collaboration with Mr. Grewgious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: May I take it you know him well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Frequently correspond with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I correspond with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Receive letters from him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have had letters from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You know his profession?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What sort?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: He is a lawyer, and I think that covers it. He is, indeed, a particular kind
of solicitor, but I think a lady might well be excused for not knowing that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: A lawyer covers everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I think that is fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What sort of business does he carry on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: She doesn’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I submit she knows nothing about Mr. Grewgious, and that she
has not had correspondence with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: The official record says she did know Mr. Grewgious, and saw him
in his Chambers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: She might know Mr. Grewgious, but have no correspondence
with him. I am asking what sort of business he carries on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I know he is a lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And nothing more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Women don’t interest themselves very much in these things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: No, I think that’s fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Now, the next time we hear anything of the official records,
Miss Landless, you were back again in London. How was that?—in your own proper
person, and ceased to be Datchery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I went up in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: In the evening?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: By the last ’bus and train.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The ’bus that leaves the Crozier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I forget exactly, but I think about six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Had you any reason for going up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I wanted to see my brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: There was no particular reason why that day more than any
other day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I think not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I suppose you will admit you were running a certain risk of discovery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, there was some, but I thought I should be able to avoid it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Anybody might follow you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Might.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You were a stranger in Cloisterham. Anybody might have
followed you to London. You were running that risk for no particular reason at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Oh! but I knew my brother was very, very unhappy, and I knew I could
cheer him and comfort him, and he was very, very dear to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your visit had nothing to do with Rosa’s visit to London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did not know she was there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Mr. Grewgious had not written and asked you to go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: No reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; the reason I have given you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But there was no particular reason?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Is it not particular to go and cheer one who is closely bound to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I think the witness’s remark is quite clear. She says she had an impulse in
an avowedly emotional atmosphere to go and see somebody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Very well. (<em>To witness.</em>) You met, you have told us, an opium
woman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And you had a conversation with her, and afterwards made a
mark on your score—your Cingalese score?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: A moderate mark; then you saw her, in the Cathedral, shake
her fist at Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Then you made a big mark. What was the meaning of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I am not sure that she is bound to answer that question. It is sufficient
that she made the mark.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I am endeavouring to show that this story is not true, as I shall
represent to the Jury, and my motive for asking the question is, that I suggest it was not
Miss Landless who made the mark. The witness who did make the mark will be summoned
later, and asked why he made it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: You ask why I made the long mark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Because I thought, when she shook her fist at Jasper, and putting with
that the fact that she had followed him, I concluded that she knew something against
him, and I thought I had scored, and scored heavily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Is that all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had learned more than that. I had learned that Edwin Drood had given
her money for opium on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What did that prove?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: We must not go into what that could prove. The witness has given a perfectly
clear and definite account of her proceedings, and I strongly suggest that unless
there is some particular point to be made, she should now be released from the witness-box,
because the other point whether she knows anything about the scoring at inns, or
whether such practices are common in Ceylon, must be left to later discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: That is not the point I am trying to make; but that there was
no reason why she should make the score, and I asked why she made it. I believe she
did not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: But if she replies that she makes long or short chalk marks, in accordance
with the ebullitions of her emotional nature——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: She is entitled to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: That would be an answer, and the only answer to which you will be entitled
at the moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: If she likes, she may.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: She has told you that she made a long stroke because she thought she had
made a great score in her own mind against Jasper, and that she made a shorter mark
before because she had not made a big score. That is all that could be expected to be got
out of her, without a self-contradiction which would amount to perjury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I have very little more to ask, and shall get through very quickly.
(<em>To witness.</em>) Now, you tell us that your motives were very compelling. You didn’t
care much about Edwin Drood, did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, there was nothing particular about him. I thought he was a nice
young fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You did? You did not call him “base and trivial”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: When he acted as he did to my brother, I felt angry, and naturally said
things I should not have said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your feelings were not very strong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your motive, you say, was care for your brother and for Miss
Rosa Bud?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you consider those motives adequate to induce you to take
the course you say you took?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Enough to make you take all risks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: To go all lengths?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: To the risk of my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was all I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Enough to compel you to do anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Anything that was right and true. You can’t catch me that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I put it to you that the whole of your story is a romance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: You put it to me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I put it to you, in fairness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Will you please consider that I am here on my oath?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span> (<em>to Judge</em>): Your Lordship knows I am bound to put that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I can only answer that every word I have spoken is true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Suppose every word you have spoken is true: is there a single
word you have spoken that proves that Edwin Drood was murdered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know that you have asked questions to elicit that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: It is not my business. Is there a word in the whole of the testimony
you have given to your own Counsel or to me that proves that Edwin Drood was
murdered? Did you, for example, see Edwin Drood murdered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you know anyone who saw the murder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Have you seen his body?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you know anyone who has seen it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t think his body could be seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Then you really have no evidence to produce to prove that
Edwin Drood is dead?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have the ring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: That is all the evidence—your whole case? I want to press this
point very much. On that ring your case rests. Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am not a woman who understands very much about legal proceedings.
It is the first time I have been in court. It is a hard thing for a clever man like you to
put a question like this to an unsophisticated witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But you are the person who has worked out the whole scheme
against Jasper. Does not the whole case for the death, not for the plan or the undertaking,
but for the death having taken place, rest on the finding of that ring?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Well, perhaps the case for incriminating, bringing it home to Jasper,
rests on the ring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And if that ring—the presence of that ring—could be satisfactorily
explained—the presence of the ring in the quicklime could be satisfactorily explained
in any other way—you would have nothing to produce to show that it was a murder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I might have no evidence, but I should be morally certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You would hold your opinion, we know, but you would have
no evidence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I think we must be careful not to get into argument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: My Lord, I am finishing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: What you and I think is evidence might be two different questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: That is indeed very probable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t think it fair to ask questions like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I will take her answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span> (<em>re-examining</em>): It does not require particular affection for any
particular person to wish that he should not be murdered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Although you might not be violently enamoured of Edwin Drood,
you might want to bring his murderer to justice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It has been suggested that your story is entirely romance. If you had
been acting a part, would you not naturally have been disgraced for ever in the eyes
of all who know you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Have you not a particular reason at present for wishing to stand high
in the esteem of certain people?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Don’t you think you would forfeit that esteem if you stood there
on your oath, and told a tissue of falsehoods?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Is there not every reason why you should tell the truth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: There is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Have you anything to gain by telling lies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have all to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Have you not been working entirely for others throughout?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You would not have taken this part if you could have helped it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And when you were making these investigations you did not want
to go to everybody and ask his definite business—“What sort of lawyer are you?”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I never thought about it. He was a lawyer, and that’s all I knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Have you ever written a tragedy that nobody will bring out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, indeed, I have not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And so you have no particular reason for standing in the limelight
and making yourself a heroine. Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: The Court will now adjourn for about ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Court accordingly adjourned. On the resumption of the proceedings, Mr.
Walters announced that the evidence of Miss Helena Landless had completed his case.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">The Case for the Defence.</span>]</p>

<p>Mr. Crotch, in opening the case for the defence, said—</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury</span>—</p>

<p>I am not going to follow the example of my learned friend, but I am merely going
to outline the defence as briefly as possible. I am going to say at once that we are not
out to attempt to dispute in any way that the prisoner desired the death of Edwin Drood
or that he intended to murder him, nor that he planned to murder him, nor that he
actually attempted to murder him, nor indeed, my Lord, that at one time, and for some
time, he did believe that he had actually murdered him. What we do say, however, is
that no murder took place. For any murder there must be, not only a murderer, but a
murdered man. Now, granted for a moment that in the prisoner at the bar you have a
potential murderer, where is the murdered man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: This is strictly against all agreements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: I will put my statement in another way, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I draw your attention to this fact: it is agreed that the legal point
that no conviction can take place since no body has been found, shall be raised only after
the retirement of the jury. This ought not to have been introduced at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: But we may assume, what is apparently the fact, that no murdered body
has been found?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But he went further, and said, “Where is the body?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: May I placate my friend and say, have we a murdered man? We
say John Jasper did not murder Edwin Drood on the Christmas Eve of 1860. We have
every reason to believe that Edwin Drood is still alive, and in that case, of course, it
follows that you cannot legally convict John Jasper for murder. Now, it will naturally
be asked how, if a murder was admittedly attempted, it can have failed, and still more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
that if it failed, how the supposed murderer could have believed that it had succeeded.
Those questions will be probably solved: we hope they will be solved by the evidence
which we shall put before you. All I think it is at the moment necessary to say is, that
the key to the story will be found in the opium habits to which the prisoner undoubtedly
was addicted. My Lord, there is a story told of an Irish priest, who, warning his congregation
against the evils of intemperance, said, “What makes you shoot at your
landlord?” And the reply came, “It’s the drink.” “And begad, what makes you fail
to shoot him?” The same reply—“It’s the drink.” My Lord and Gentlemen of the
Jury, we submit that, in a word, is the story of John Jasper. Now John Jasper is—presumably
my friend will admit it—he has tried to prove it—I don’t think he has
demonstrated much by it—he has tried to get out of his witnesses that this man was an
opium smoker. From our point of view that is excellent. We say that John Jasper had,
on the night previous to this murderous attack on Edwin Drood, indulged in a gross
opium debauch, and because he did, in the midst of the commission of his crime he had
one of those sudden seizures to which he was subjected, and that under the influence of
opium he failed to complete the crime, but still believed that he had. Because he was
under the influence of opium, he completed it in imagination, and then afterwards imagined
that he had completed it in fact; and because his victim—and this is the point that I
want to draw your attention to especially—because his victim also was under the influence
of opium, having been drugged by Jasper, he failed to give any connected or reasonable
and rational account of what had happened in these circumstances. That, I submit, my
Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, is the outline. The details will be presently filled in
by witnesses, who will testify. You will perceive that if it is true—and we shall prove it
to be true—then John Jasper, whatever his intention, however great his moral obliquity,
cannot be legally convicted of murder.—Eliza Lascar, alias the “Princess Puffer.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Usher</span>: Eliza Lascar, alias “Princess Puffer”!
[The witness entered the witness-box, and was duly sworn.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Are you sworn?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Your name, I believe, is Eliza Lascar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, deary. Oh, my lungs is so weak!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: My dear lady!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Oh, my lungs!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You are known as “Princess Puffer”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, deary. I got Heavens-hard drunk for sixteen year afore I took to
this; but this don’t hurt me, not to speak of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You keep an opium den in the East End of London, I believe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Know him! Better far than all the Reverend Parsons put together know him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: He is a customer of yours, I believe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: When he first came to me he was quite new to it, but after a while he could
take his pipe with the best of ’em, deary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: I conclude from that he was a heavy opium smoker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Do you remember his being in your place on the night of the twelfth
of December?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was, deary. I see him coming to, and I says, deary, “Get him another
ready when he wakes, and he will remember the market price of opium is very high.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: What was the date he next visited you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: December 23, my deary dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You need not be so affectionate. What happened next day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I followed him to his home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: What happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I lost him where the omnibus he got into nigh his journey’s end plies
betwixt the station and the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you meet anybody else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I met a dear gentleman named Edwin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: What did you say to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I said to him, “My lungs is weak, my lungs is bad”—and the dear
gentleman he put three-and-sixpence in my hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: And when did you next meet the prisoner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Oh, my poor head! In 1861. He comes to me all over like for the want
of a smoke. I says, “You have come to the right place. This is the place where the
all overs is smoked off.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Then what happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Then what happened, deary? I follows him to Aldersgate Street, the
place where he puts up, and I finds out where he comes from, and I says to my poor self
“I missed you the first time, and I swore my oath I will not lose you again, my gentleman
from Cloisterham. I’ll go there first, and bide your coming.” And I did. I goes to
Cloisterham, and I waits outside the Nun’s House, just where the omnibus goes, and
he gets down, and I follows him up a bystreet till he disappears under a archway to
the left. I turns round, and he was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you see any one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A white-haired gentleman who told me that his name was Datchery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you go to the Cathedral next morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you see the prisoner there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I see him from behind a pillar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: You recognised him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I recognised him, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you afterwards meet the white-haired gentleman you have spoken of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did, deary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Did you tell him you knew the prisoner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I told him that I knew him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I said, “I know him. I know him better than all the Reverend Parsons
put together knows him.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crotch</span>: Thank you.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">“Princess Puffer” Cross-examined.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Just one question. When you met Edwin Drood, I think you told
him “Ned” was a threatened name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What did you mean by “threatened”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It was a bad name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you think a man threatened is in danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It sounds like it, deary, don’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It does. I want you to agree with me. I think you were in the habit
of listening to Mr. Jasper when he had a little opium?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Ever hear him say the word “Ned”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I can’t recollect. I should think he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What made you hit upon the name “Ned” as a threatened name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He talked about him in a very unkind way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You say the man threatened was in danger. Did you think “Ned”
in danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I heard what he said. Shall I tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Not what he said. It doesn’t matter. But I want to know that “Ned”
was a threatened name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That’s right, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Were you giving warning to anybody of the name of “Ned”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I told him it was a threatened name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you know he was called “Ned”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I asked him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you know who called him “Ned”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: If I told you that Jasper, and Jasper alone, called him “Ned”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should believe you, deary. I should believe you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you would therefore also believe that Jasper was threatening him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And that he meant it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, deary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: So you think there was murder in the mind of John Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think he wanted to do him harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you love John Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I suppose you don’t love any of your customers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t care much about ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But you don’t turn them away? When they come to you you take
their money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you always follow your customers down to their private residences?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Why this one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He had money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What! A poor man in a choir had got money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He had money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It was worth all your while to go all the way to Cloisterham after
one customer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He had such a lot of money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; to me he had. I’m only a poor woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He was richer than all your other customers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You think so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You don’t know where all this money came from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You hated him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you wanted his money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes. He was always a-listening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I thought it was you listening?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Sometimes I would listen, and once he spoke to me of a hazardous
journey, and he said, “I did it a hundred million times; I did it so often, that when
it came to be really done, it was not worth the doing, it was done so soon, and when it
comes to be real, it was so short that for the first time it seemed to be unreal. No struggle,
no sign of danger, no consciousness of peril! I never dreamt that before.” That’s
what he said, my deary dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Well, he said, when it came to be done it was so short it was not
worth doing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He said it was not real for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He talked about a real thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He says, deary, “When it comes to be real it seems to be unreal for the
first time,” my deary dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He said, “when it comes to be real”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: “It seems unreal for the first time,” my poppett.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But when a man says “a real thing,” he means a real thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: My Lord!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: There is some element of paradox involved here. I cannot consent to allow
the witness to be attacked merely because a criminal says that that which seemed real
before it happened appeared unreal when it happened, because I suppose most of us in
this room have committed crimes at some time or other, and that is a possible state of affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I will not ask any more questions, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span> (<em>re-examining</em>): When you say that you imagined the prisoner
was rich as compared with your other clients—they would be Chinamen and sailors
and Lascars?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: They was very poor, deary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He was a different class of man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was, my poppett.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: The other question I want to ask you is this: When you told
Mr. Drood that “Ned” was a threatened name, what did Mr. Drood say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He says, “But threatened men live long.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: “Then,” I says to him, “Ned, so threatened is he, whoever he be,
while I’m a talking to you, that he should live to all eternity.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Thank you. Call Thomas Bazzard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Usher</span>: Thomas Bazzard!</p>

<p>[That gentleman entered the witness-box and was duly sworn.]</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Evidence of Thomas Bazzard.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Your name is Thomas Bazzard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What is your profession?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am a clerk and investigator to Mr. Grewgious, of Staple Inn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Mr. Grewgious is not, as he is wrongfully described I believe,
in the indictment, a solicitor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; Mr. Grewgious is a member of the Bar, but is not practising. He is
Receiver and Manager of two large estates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And what sort of work do you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I believe the work that I am at present engaged in is colloquially known
as that of a “noser.” That is to say, I am engaged partly in collecting the rents, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
partly in inquiring what is going on with his tenants—whether they are stealing the
game, and improperly dispersing the stock. Largely work of investigation outside the office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When did you enter his employment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Ten years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Where were you born?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am the son of a Norfolk farmer, I am sorry to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: If your employer said, “It would be extremely difficult to replace
Mr. Bazzard,” that would refer to your inquiry work?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think that would refer to my inquiry work. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Mr. Grewgious treats you rather respectfully?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Mr. Grewgious is extremely kind to me, and as he values my work outside,
he allows a great deal of latitude as to my behaviour inside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Now, when did you first see Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think I saw him—by the way, I should like to point out that Mr. Grewgious
was not the legal adviser to Edwin Drood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You might explain that to the Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I noticed in the copy of the Agreement that he was the legal adviser to
Edwin Drood. So far as I know, that is not the case. I first saw him some time before
Christmas 1860, at the office of Mr. Grewgious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Did Mr. Grewgious tell you about Mr. Drood’s coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He did. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And what was the general instruction that Mr. Grewgious gave you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: These instructions: he said he was going to have a private conversation—more
or less private conversation—with Mr. Drood, and if I appeared to be very
interested in it, it might embarrass Mr. Drood, and that therefore I should not pay any
particular attention to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: What happened was this: I think we all had dinner, and then Mr. Grewgious
had the private conversation in question. I understood that what happened was
that he admonished Mr. Drood as to his proper feelings towards his future bride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: You did not hear that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I didn’t hear that. I took the opportunity to have a snooze. Waking
up, Mr. Grewgious said to me, “I have handed a ring of diamonds and rubies to Mr.
Drood.” Mr. Drood handed a case and said, “You see?” I said, “I follow you both,
sir, and I witness the transaction.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What was the next occasion you saw him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The next occasion I saw Mr. Edwin Drood was Jan. 1st, 1861.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: That was a week after you first met him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Where did you meet him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: At a hotel in Holborn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Did you hear what happened to him after that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: After that, I was informed that he was very seriously ill with rheumatic
fever, and was sent abroad to the South of France to get his health back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Did Mr. Grewgious ever tell you how he came across Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: What he told me was this: that on Christmas Eve, 1860, he received
very late at night, a letter from Miss Rosa Bud, his ward, to whom he was very much
attached, and, if I may be allowed to remark, to whose mother he was very devotedly
attached also. This letter was written by Miss Bud immediately following her conversation
with Mr. Edwin Drood, which is in the Official Record, I think, and it entreated
Mr. Grewgious, in very strong terms, to be with her in Cloisterham on Christmas Day.
The letter reached Mr. Grewgious very late in the evening, and owing to the defects
of the railway system, some of which, I am glad to learn, have been altered since, it was
impossible for Mr. Grewgious to get to Cloisterham except by posting down, which he
accordingly did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: There was no train after eight o’clock?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: At that time no train after eight o’clock—from Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He posted down, and what do you understand he did when he
arrived at Cloisterham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He told me that he drove into Cloisterham somewhere about 5.30.
Passing the Postern Gate, he stopped his carriage, and asked it to wait a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He wanted to walk through the gate into the Churchyard, a few yards—some
40 or 50 yards, I think—in order to put some flowers on the grave of Miss
Rosa Bud’s mother, as I think it is stated in the official documents, he was very much
attached to Miss Bud’s mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When he got there, whom did he find?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He found Edwin Drood lying prone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And what did he do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I believe the first thing he did was to pick him up. He then shook him
together, begged him to speak to him, and questioned him, and Edwin Drood entreated
him to take him out of Cloisterham without any delay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I understand, Mr. Bazzard, from your narrative, that Mr. Drood
could give practically no coherent account of what had happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: None whatever, beyond the fact that somebody had tried to strangle
him, as he thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When you saw him, what sort of memory had he of that night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Vague and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He could not have sworn that either Neville Landless or Jasper
had attacked him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He could not swear anything, except that he had been attacked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: His sympathies leaned, of course, to Jasper rather than to
Landless?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was very loath indeed to think that his uncle, whom he had cherished
with very great respect and esteem, had been concerned in the attempt to murder him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: If he could have given evidence then, I take it he would have
given evidence rather in favour of Jasper than of Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That depends on the Jury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I was going to remark that the question goes a little outside anything the
witness is called upon to answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: He was more inclined to——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: On this point the witness has made a very remarkable statement;
that Mr. Grewgious shook Mr. Drood together. May I ask how many pieces Drood
was in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I think the question should be answered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I was not there, my Lord, at the time. I merely repeat what Mr.
Grewgious told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: You attribute it to a violent metaphor on the part of Mr. Grewgious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It is right that I should put the Jury in possession of all matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Juryman</span> (Mr. William Archer): May I ask where Mr. Grewgious is in the
meantime? Met with a violent death?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: If the Jury will look at the Official Record——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: I am sorry to explain, my Lord, that all our documents have gone,
covered with our autographs. (Further copies of the Official Documents were handed
to the Jury by the Clerk of Arraigns.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: If the Jury have the Document, they will see the last paragraph
but one explains the matter. (<em>To Witness.</em>) You then saw Mr. Grewgious. What did
Mr. Grewgious say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: What he said was this: that he personally very strongly suspected
Jasper, but that Drood’s recollections as to what happened on that evening were so
confused and incoherent that any testimony he might have to give would not either
clear Landless, or incriminate Jasper. He therefore said this: that if Landless were
committed for trial it would be necessary to produce Drood, but failing that, he had
better keep his continued existence a secret until matters had died down at Cloisterham,
and until Jasper thought he was entirely secure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And therefore, what was Mr. Grewgious’s plan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: His plan was this: that if I went down to Cloisterham prosecuting
inquiries there, I should detect Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And you did so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did so. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When you went down, how did the case present itself to you
as a problem?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I thought from what Mr. Grewgious told me about the case, that there
were three cardinal mysteries. One was why Drood, if he had been murderously
assaulted, could give no clear account, as to who had assaulted him; the second was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
why, if the prisoner was the author of that murderous assault, he had not effected it;
and in the third place, why, having failed to kill Drood, he obviously thought he had
killed him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Having put those three things to yourself, you went down to
Cloisterham and disguised yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I went to a costumier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You did not make up your face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You were not known there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: As far as I know, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: But there might be an offchance, and so you put on a costume?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You went to the Crozier, and ordered a veal cutlet, a mutton
chop, and a pint of sherry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes—and I drank the sherry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And asked the waiter about lodgings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You asked for something Cathedrally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I thought I ought to get something near the Cathedral, so as to be near
to Jasper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: They recommended you to Mr. Tope’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: They did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And you set out to go there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I was told I should find the house on the right-hand side. It was so obvious
that I went past it. I went on up a lane called Crow Lane, I believe, into the Vineries,
and somewhere about there I met the boy named Deputy. I asked him to take me to
Tope’s, which he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He took you to within sight, didn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; I beg pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He pointed out a window?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You said, “That’s Tope’s”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; I thought it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: He said it was Jasper’s?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; and I looked at it with some interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You saw Jasper subsequently?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You called on him to inquire about the Tope’s? You made that
opportunity to call?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You walked about the Cathedral; met Sapsea and Durdles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You met Deputy again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And there was a conversation, I think, between you and Deputy,
in which you said he was to take you to Durdles’s house when you wished?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: After you installed yourself in the Tope’s lodgings, how did
you propose to keep a record of your successes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I rather amused myself by opening the cupboard door in my room, and
chalking it up as is done in taverns which on occasions I have visited in Ceylon—I mean
Norfolk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You were brought up as a boy in Norfolk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And they keep chalk scores there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: They used to chalk it up by means of long or short lines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Generally according to the date of the week?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The big lines at the end of the week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You kept this record in this fashion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Will you carry your mind back to one evening, I think in July,
when Jasper came home comparatively late, and went under the archway, and passed
up the staircase?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Do you remember an old woman following?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What passed between you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I asked her if she was looking for anybody, and she, in substance, said
that she would like to know the name and address of that gentleman. Then we had
some further conversation, and she asked me, first of all for money for her lodgings,
and then she asked for money for what she described as opium, which I gave her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: She also mentioned an interview with a young gentleman on the
previous Christmas Eve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, she told me she had been to Cloisterham before on Christmas Eve,
and that she had met a youth named Ned, I think it was, who had also given her money.
I took it she had been down on the same business as that night—following the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When you had done that, you went to your score?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: When I had done that, I met Deputy, and he told me that “’Er Royal
Highness the Princess Puffer” was staying at the Travellers’ Tuppeny, and that she
kept an opium den in the East End of London, and then I had very little doubt that
that was the place from which she had followed the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You told her where she could see the prisoner next morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: She saw him, and shook her fist at him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: She used dreadful language which is not even in the Official Records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: When she came out, did you say to her, “Have you seen him?”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And did she say that she had seen him, and knew him better
than all the Reverend Parsons put together?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: You then went to the cupboard door, and what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I made a great score.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What was its meaning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That my interview with, and observations of the opium woman had settled
the three main questions as to which I had gone down to Cloisterham to decide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Let us take them seriatim. First, how was it Drood——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: From my conversation with her I gathered that Jasper took opium, and
having opium, I had no doubt at all that he drugged Drood’s wine, and that Drood
was so affected as not to be able to give any clear account as to the event.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: The second question—How was it that, if the prisoner was the
author of the assault, he had not achieved his purpose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: My views as to that also were clear. He had been at the opium den on the
night before the Christmas Eve, when she last visited Cloisterham, and I have no doubt
at all that he failed because he had an opium seizure—such a seizure as Mr. Grewgious
saw him in, and as his nephew Drood saw him in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: The third question—How came it, that having failed to kill
Drood, he obviously thought he had done so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That, I thought, was obvious, because he would have completed the
murder in an opium trance, such a trance as, later, the “Princess Puffer” described to me,
as Jasper having experienced inside the opium den.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: We have already heard from the “Princess Puffer” about its being
unreal for the first time. That would fit in with your theory?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I am afraid the witness must have no theory. As soon as the examination
has put its main point, we must go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span> (<em>to witness</em>): Then, did you get any confirmation of that view
from Mr. Grewgious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, I wrote to Mr. Grewgious, and he told me of the seizure on Boxing
Day—I think it was Boxing Day—when he had an interview with Jasper, the prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: And also did he tell you that Edwin Drood remembered his
uncle in a seizure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I remember that also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Did you gather that Drood had had his wine drugged on a
previous occasion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I gather that from the Official Records.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Then, did you claim your promise from Deputy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: We have been told in evidence that a ring was put in the crypt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Does that surprise you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Not in the least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Because I put it there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: What was your object in pursuing that course?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: This was the ring, I may say, that I had seen pass from Mr. Grewgious
to Drood, of the existence of which, I may perhaps point out, it is obvious from the
study of the Official Records, Jasper knew nothing at all; and acting under instructions
from Mr. Grewgious, who had received the ring back from Drood, I obtained with the
assistance of my friend Durdles access to the Sapsea vault, and therein I placed the
ring. My object in doing that was, that subsequently, when Mr. Grewgious offered
a reward for the discovery of the ring, the prisoner could be entrapped into a visit to
the vault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I take it, Mr. Grewgious would plaster Cloisterham with the
description of the ring as believed to be on the person of Edwin Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is what he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: It would be a large placard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Rather like this? (<em>Handing to the witness a reproduction of the original
cover design for the book.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Very like the second illustration from the top on the left-hand side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Very well: that was your plan—that Jasper should be caught
taking the ring, and thus be convicted of attempted murder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Of which you believed him to be guilty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Beyond doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: It is not my business to ask you what happened, but I suppose
somehow or other he got arrested for actual murder. Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Thomas Bazzard Cross-examined.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span> (<em>cross-examining</em>): I think you have said several times that you come
from Norfolk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I was born in Norfolk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Is that the country where the dumplings come from?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Some, no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Where you come from also!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Curious coincidence! You are a farmer’s son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And very ambitious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have not said so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Don’t you want to get on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t think that is very ambitious. I think being very ambitious is
more than wanting to get on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: In order to get on you came to London from Norfolk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: A good many people have done that before, I am afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You wanted to give London the benefit of any genius you had?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Thank you very much indeed. I wanted to be usefully employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you became professionally engaged to Mr. Grewgious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you occupied the responsible and honourable position of “Noser”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Quite right. The best position I could get.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And he treated you with great respect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Remarkable respect from a barrister to his clerk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is due to the fact that he is a man of exceptional graciousness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you treated him with great respect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I worked for him, I think, very hard, and with very great fidelity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I said you treated him with great respect. I did not ask about your
fidelity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: You will forgive my mentioning it, won’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Now do you mind replying to the question? You treated him with
very great respect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: If you ever gave him a surly answer, would that be respectful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know. It would depend on the degree of surliness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you took his money as a good and faithful servant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And were absolutely devoted to his interests?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: So that on one occasion you fell asleep while he was talking?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; but in pursuance to his instructions. He told me that a conversation
was going to take place which was no affair of mine, and that he was not particularly
anxious for me to overhear it. But he was very anxious that I should witness the transaction
at the end of the conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Would it not have been more respectful to walk out of the room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think not. It would place him in an extremely awkward position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You preferred to fall asleep and snore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: May I answer? If I had gone out, Mr. Grewgious would have had to
come for me, and to have told Edwin Drood that he required a witness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You preferred to fall asleep and snore in the presence of a client?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had forty winks after dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You had forty winks, as you call it, while your employer was
engaged with an important client?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In a conversation which I was not supposed to hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you frequently fall asleep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I have no desire to slumber at present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: No; I think we shall wake you up presently. Do you usually sleep
when respectable clients enter your office?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; I don’t usually receive such instructions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: That was the only respectful way of treating your master and client?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have had no remonstrance from Mr. Grewgious for it. I am still in his
employment. He thought it was worth his while to go on employing me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Mr. Bazzard, the story you have told proves to me that you have
rather a strong imagination. Am I right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: If it proves it to you, my good sir, by all means. I prefer to answer questions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But probably you have also convinced the Jury that you are a
gentleman of some imagination?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It’s not for me to say—only to tender my evidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I believe you have written a Drama?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Once, many years ago, when a young man, I did write a Tragedy. A
dreadful admission! I hope no other witness whose veracity is challenged——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: What was the name of that Tragedy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It is “The Thorn of Anxiety.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Has it ever come out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It is, I suppose, a work of great genius?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should not like to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But all plays are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Do you think so! If you would like to read it, I should be delighted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I don’t wish you to be modest. Dramatists usually are not. I suppose
there are such things as good dramas and bad dramas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: There are certainly bad dramas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Just to give us your opinion: do you think yours was good or bad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t know. I am naturally impressed in its favour, but several people—some
people to whom I submitted it—they rather doubt it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: They don’t think there is any “Magic” in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I don’t want you to think for a moment that all dramatists are bad
people. I only mean that you may possibly have written a bad drama.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: There are several dramatists on the Jury, and they can take their impression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You would not give a reason why it has not come out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t think it is up to me. If I am asked for a reason, one is I have had
very little time to push its merits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I suppose though, that even bad plays are produced sometimes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No doubt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It’s not only the bad ones, though, that are accepted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It must be a bad play that does not get accepted in these days?
When a man of genius such as you——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Please; if you don’t mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: It is not in evidence that this man is a genius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: I respectfully submit that it is in evidence that he has written a play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: Very true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: When a man of your ability, of some little ambition, cannot get
his play accepted, he sometimes resorts to other means—other than the ordinary means?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I could not tell you. I have only tried the ordinary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You are a legal gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You are connected with the law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Not connected with a lawyer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Know nothing about the law?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I wouldn’t say that. I thought all Englishmen were supposed to understand
the Statutes under which they live. I am in the office of a barrister who is not
acting as a barrister, but as Receiver and Manager of two large estates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And therefore no lawyer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It is not for me to say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you think you can give a straightforward answer to any plain
question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think I have done so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You have probably heard that unsuccessful authors and dramatists,
when they cannot get their plays or books accepted by ordinary means, adopt little
devices?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t think I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You have never heard of an actress losing her jewels, or an author
pretending to commit suicide?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have heard of them actually doing it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Ever heard of an author saying he has been to the North Pole, and
writing a book? Would it not be absolutely providential if something occurred to you
to bring you into notoriety?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It would not relieve your “Thorn of Anxiety”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: In other words, would it not rather be to your advantage to be talked
about as a hero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have never seriously considered the proposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You are rather fond of theatricals, are you not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Fond of the Drama?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am rather too busy to be interested in it. As I have told you, I am
too busy——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Yes or no?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: You ought to take my answer. I say I have been too engaged in looking
after my livelihood to take a lively interest in the British Drama.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You do take an interest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Does your employer know it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He has seen your play?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It rather interested him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I think what interested him was my work for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He is a keen man, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I know. I can tell you he is not interested in the Drama.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You have a few friends who are interested in the Drama? Do you
meet a few fellow Dramatists?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: But it is in the Official Records that you do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Then, I must be wrong, and I do. I was told to answer “yes or no.” I
meet a few people who are interested in the Drama, having attempted plays as I have.
I meet them at rather long but happy intervals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I suppose they would like their plays produced?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I dare say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Once more I ask you—and do please give a straightforward
answer—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: With great respect, I very much resent that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you think it would be to your advantage to be a little famous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I must interpose, because I don’t think I know any human being in the world
who would not think it to his advantage to be rather famous. Also I must remind the
Court that two speeches have to be made on both sides, and we are all in high hopes of
hanging somebody, and it really ought to be abbreviated if possible. I don’t think anyone
can say that the answers of the present witness have been such as in any way to expose
him to discredit, but if the barrister examining desires to ask a few more questions, by
all means let him do so, and then I think we should pass on as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I could achieve very great notoriety if I were hanged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: Yes: live in hopes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span> (continuing his cross-examination): Datchery is rather a famous
person at present?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And I suppose you consider it an honour to be considered Datchery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I am proud to have worked down there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You knew a little about the Drood case?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You knew a little of it from Mr. Grewgious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have stated that it was Mr. Grewgious’s idea that I should go down
there and investigate in character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It was not a dramatic inspiration?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The inspiration was Mr. Grewgious’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: When you fell asleep on that occasion, were you pretending?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You were not preparing for the part of Datchery in advance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Datchery never snored, did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You were not preparing a part?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I had no idea that Mr. Drood was going to be murdered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You were not pretending, therefore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I was not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You are a man of short sentences, according to the Official Record?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Very abrupt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Have you given us only two or three words to-night in your sentences?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have been answering under some provocation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did your Counsel provoke you to your long sentences?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I trust not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Were you pretending when you gave those short sentences in Mr.
Datchery’s character?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No; but a man in the witness-box is not a good criterion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I suppose you can write?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I suppose your professional standing teaches you to keep correct
records?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You did not keep the usual records making your investigations in
Cloisterham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: What are the usual records?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I put it to you that you did not write anything down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Why did you use the chalk marks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Merely as a matter for my own amusement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Were they to be used in any way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I should say not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You valued your time so much that you wasted it by putting chalk
marks on a door!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: The amount of time would not be much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You were not going to take the cupboard door to London as evidence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: It was all a waste of your time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes; but harmless. Even a rejected dramatist is entitled to have some
hobby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You know John Jasper?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Did you ever see him take opium?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Never.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Do you know how long an opium fit lasts?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No. I imagine it rather depends on the amount of opium taken, and
various other circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Suppose a man was in the habit of having a particular smoke of
opium—mixing it in a particular way; do you think it would be over in a few minutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I could not tell you. Nor do I know whether he had those habits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You don’t think it would take a few hours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Would it surprise you to know that after an orgy he would be clear-headed
in the morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Nothing would surprise me, I think, from the little I have read of their
literature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You know nothing about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: As a matter of experience, that is the exhilarating fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You never saw Jasper taking opium?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: And you watched him in Cloisterham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In the street. He never took any there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You believe that possibly he made a desperate attack on Edwin
Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes, I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: He would possibly make an attack on someone else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Don’t you think, therefore, you were in some danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I don’t think I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You don’t think you were in danger from a man who might make
an attack? Are you a man of very great nerve?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: It’s not for me to say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I don’t think you have any right to ask him that. That is a matter of personal
knowledge. It might be settled in a fight outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: One or two more questions. Have you a great affection for Edwin
Drood?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I have not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Nor for Neville Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: No interest in Miss Helena Landless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: No interest whatever in any of the parties?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Business interest only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Then, why did you risk your valuable life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: In the first place, I don’t think I exposed my life, valuable or otherwise,
to any great risk. Why I went down there was because Mr. Grewgious asked me to do so,
and because he had been a very generous and considerate employer to me, and I also
thought that if I had good results he would reward me suitably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Can you give me any explanation, if Drood has disappeared, why he
has not communicated with his friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: That is surely a point for final discussion in abstract debate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I only ask if he can offer any explanation. (<em>To witness.</em>) Should you
expect a man who has disappeared, and finding all his friends in danger, to communicate
with his friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: On that hypothetical case, I think I should. But that has no reference to
the Drood question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I think we should confine ourselves as sharply as we can to bringing out the
actual facts, and not to abstract argument.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span> (<em>to witness</em>): Can you give us any reason why he should not communicate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I cannot: but he has communicated with his friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Are you going to produce any evidence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: That is in the hands of Counsel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: Don’t you think the white wig would give you away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: I can’t tell you. I was in the hands of a costumier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: You can go back to Norfolk, Mr. Bazzard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Witness</span>: Thank you, I am going back to the City.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I have no intention of cross-examining this witness. That
concludes my case.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Speech for the Defence.</span>]</p>

<p>Mr. Chesterton proceeded to address the Court for the defence. He said:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">My Lord, Gentlemen of the Jury</span>:</p>

<p>I rise to speak in defence of the prisoner in circumstances in many ways difficult
and even unfortunate. This is a case which has unfortunately been very much discussed,
and very much written about, on which many people have preconceived opinions.
I had, indeed, almost thought of appealing to your Lordship to commit at least one
well-known man of letters for Contempt of Court, for a very improper article which
appeared in yesterday’s <cite>Daily Mail</cite>. But, as I say, this is a case which we cannot pretend
that any of us comes fresh to. Probably you, Gentlemen of the Jury, have some of you
read about it, but I want to point out to you that, situated as you are to-day, you are
bound by your oath to give us your decision quite irrespective of any previous opinions
which you may have held, quite irrespective of anything that you may have read, or
written, or heard; that you are bound to give your opinions on the evidence, on the
evidence which has been offered to the Court to-day. And on that evidence I, without
a moment’s hesitation, claim an acquittal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>What is the situation? Now, apart from the formal witnesses, whose evidence is
not much disputed on either side, but to whose evidence I shall have to refer in some
detail in a moment—apart from this, we have had two principal witnesses in the box
to-day. Now it is obvious that one or other of them is not telling the truth. That is clear
and unmistakeable. One of the questions you have to put yourselves is, Which of them
was telling the truth, and which was telling falsehoods? You can test that in a good
many ways, but whichever way, you will come to the same conclusion—that if there
was a witness who was telling the truth it was Thomas Bazzard—if there was a witness
who was romancing, it was Miss Helena Landless. What do we know about these two?
Mr. Thomas Bazzard is a clerk in the office of a well-known business man; Miss Helena
Landless is a young lady from Ceylon. Very much, no doubt, comes from there, but
we have learned this evening, as one of the most amazing bits of her evidence, that the
old English tavern scores come from there!</p>

<p>Now, let us consider first of all. What about the motives? Here is Bazzard. Bazzard
has no motive—no motive whatever—for attempting to secure the release of the prisoner.
Miss Helena Landless has admitted in that box on her oath that her hatred of Jasper
had nothing whatever to do with the assassination of Edwin Drood. Her hatred of Jasper
does not rest on the fact that Jasper has killed Edwin Drood at all. It rests on the fact
that Jasper has treated in an unfortunate way her brother, and her friend, Miss Rosa
Bud. So there you have her confession that she had a very real motive for hunting down
the prisoner. Miss Helena Landless has told her story. She says she was Datchery.
What is the first thing that strikes us about that extraordinary story? I asked her whether
she made up her face, and she said she did not. Now, had she said that she made up her
face, had she said she had painted herself wrinkles, it might have been just possible to
ask a sane man to believe that she could go about Cloisterham, where she was well
known, and not be recognised: but how can she have the effrontery to go into that
box and ask the Jury to believe that she went about the town where she had been living
for nine months, and where she was perfectly well known—round the Nuns’ House
where she had been at school; round Canon Crisparkle’s house where she had been a
visitor; and round the Cathedral—and that, with her face absolutely unchanged, and
merely a white wig and a blue coat! And she asks you to believe that she did that, and
that she called on the people who knew her best, and that they did not recognise her!
Really, after that, can we be expected to believe one word of her evidence? Really,
that is so strong and so monstrous an attempt on our credulity, that I am willing to
waive all the other nonsensical parts of her story. There is her way of avoiding suspicion.
She wishes to pass as an old buffer. Her idea is to order with a gargantuan meal an
enormous quantity of wine and not to drink it! When I pressed her, she said she
poured it away. Is it reasonable? It is not necessary to the character of an old buffer
that she should drink a pint of sherry. But her whole story! I asked her where she
learned to keep tavern scores. Gentlemen, you know what the way of keeping tavern
scores means. It is the notorious old English custom of “scoring a man up.” As many
of you may know, and as Mr. Bazzard has sworn, in evidence, it is a custom particularly
of Norfolk. That is a perfectly natural action for Bazzard. Had Miss Landless
said a Norfolk man or a countryman had told her, we might have believed her. But
she said she learned it in Ceylon! I am rather surprised she did not say it was an
accomplishment taught at Miss Twinkleton’s! Her theory that she could act as an
old buffer is so absurd——because when she was thirteen years old she put on her
brother’s knickerbockers. It is absurd. As if that would help a woman of 21 to pass as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
an old buffer! So I unhesitatingly ask you to accept the evidence of Bazzard, and
reject that of Miss Helena Landless.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of the matter. If you believe the testimony of Bazzard,
which is unshaken—it has not been shaken on one point by my learned friend, and not
challenged in one single point—if you believe the evidence of Bazzard, you must acquit
the prisoner. You must find the prisoner Not Guilty, because Bazzard has sworn that
he has seen the alleged murdered man since the attempted murder. If you believe that,
you must acquit the prisoner. But it does not follow—and this point I want particularly
to emphasise—it does not follow that if you believe the story of Miss Helena Landless
you ought to convict the prisoner. As a matter of fact, Miss Helena Landless has not
produced, if her story is true, one little rag of evidence in favour of the guilt of John
Jasper. She has, indeed, produced a certain amount of evidence suggesting that he
planned an attempt on Edwin Drood’s life, but the defence admit that. She has produced
a certain amount of evidence that John Jasper thought he had murdered him; but she
has produced no rag of evidence that the murder took place. I ask you to believe the
evidence of Bazzard, and I point out that my learned friend has not challenged the
evidence of Bazzard.</p>

<p>I took Miss Landless through the whole of her story. She was a wonderfully good
witness, but at every point she had to give some extravagant explanation to cover herself.
My learned friend, able Counsel as he is, did not ask Bazzard one question hardly
about his story. He devoted the whole of his cross-examination to trying to suggest
that Bazzard was a great fool, that he had written a bad tragedy which is not in evidence,
and that it has not been produced. Suppose he had produced a bad tragedy, and was
vain of it. My learned friend may have heard of Frederick the Great, who was very vain
of very bad verses. My learned friend has confined himself to saying that he must be
telling lies because he is a fool. That is self-contradictory. We have seen him in the box
subjected to cross-examination by one of the ablest Counsel at the Bar, and I ask you
who saw him to say whether he is a liar or a fool. If he be lying it is impossible to believe
that he is not a man of very remarkable ability. The fact that he is a man of low ability
is my friend’s only reason for calling him a liar! I ask you to believe the testimony of
Bazzard; and you must then acquit the prisoner.</p>

<p>But, as I was saying just now, Miss Helena Landless does not produce any evidence;
nor does Durdles; nor Canon Crisparkle; not a shred of evidence to show that the murder
took place. I had Miss Landless—an able, determined witness—and I challenged her,
could she produce one tittle of evidence, other than the ring, to prove that Drood was
murdered? and she had to admit, unwillingly, that she could produce none. She said
she still retained her opinions. I am sure she would! We can perfectly estimate the
attitude of mind of Miss Landless as one of bitter hatred of the prisoner and readiness
to believe anything against him. I have no doubt that if Edwin Drood walked into court,
she would still think Jasper murdered him. The only thing she can produce is the ring.
If you believe Bazzard’s evidence, there is no mystery about the ring. It was put there
by him. But suppose you don’t believe it: there are a hundred ways by which it might
have got there. I could give you half a dozen straight away. Jasper might, in going through
Edwin’s pockets to take out the watch and chain, have dropped the ring in the trance.
Drood himself might have taken out the ring and dropped it. There are a hundred possible
explanations of the presence of the ring, but there is no possible explanation of the
absence of everything else except the ring. Quicklime will destroy the body, but I do ask
whether it is conceivable that Edwin Drood had absolutely no metallic objects about him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
of any kind. I suggest that he might have had metal trouser buttons—unless he was a
member of some extraordinary religious community, or some hygienic body which
disapproves of anybody wearing anything of the kind!</p>

<p>My friend has made a great deal of the question of the enormous risks. Miss Landless
flouted her enormous risks, and Mr. Walters flouted the enormous risks in Bazzard’s
face. Mr. Bazzard, who is supposed to be a boaster, did not see that he had run such
risks. Nor do I. One of the propositions of the prosecution is that Jasper was an extraordinarily
brilliant criminal. Of course, he was the reverse. What is admitted by the
prosecution itself is ample for my purpose. We say that Jasper bungled the whole thing
and did not kill his man; but supposing he did kill him, there is no doubt he bungled.
Just think. This clever criminal, who kills a man, is content with his own memory that
that man had nothing on him but a watch and chain and pin; drags them out; never
thinks he might have some money, although he is staking his neck, or chance of survival,
entirely on the assumption that everything will be destroyed by quicklime. He never
takes the ordinary precaution to see if there is anything else. It is so amazingly absurd
that it would be incredible if we did not know, as we do know, that he was under the
influence of a drug and was not master of his faculties when the crime was being
committed.</p>

<p>I conclude by just saying this: I am aware that I appear in one sense at
a great disadvantage because I am unable to claim any sympathy for my client. I
cannot put it to you that my client has been wronged morally by the accusation.
I cannot claim your sympathies for him. Undoubtedly he hated his nephew, and planned
his murder; undoubtedly he is morally guilty of this murder; but, Gentlemen of the
Jury, those things are not within your province. You are not here to judge the soul of
John Jasper. You are here to decide whether he has committed the legal crime of murder.
Unless that is proved, and proved up to the hilt, you have no right to find him guilty.
And I would just say this: if you go beyond your rightful province of pronouncing
on that simple matter of fact, you are perhaps thwarting some purpose higher than we
know of.</p>

<p>It may not be for nothing that this man has been reserved for this very strange
destiny, to have the moral guilt of murder on his head, to have all the remorse for murder
in his heart, and yet by a strangely marvellous fate to keep his hand actually free from
human blood. Perhaps He who created John Jasper intended for him a destiny more
terrible than human punishment, some expiation more terrible than the gallows; and
I ask you to give the benefit of the doubt to the prisoner in the dock. Respect upon his
brow the sign of that mysterious immunity. Let Cain pass by, for he belongs to God.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">Reply for the Prosecution.</span>]</p>

<p>Mr. Walters then replied for the Prosecution in the following terms:</p>

<p class="no-indent">May it please you, <span class="smcap">My Lord, Gentlemen of the Jury</span>—</p>

<p>Although this case has many complications, the issue itself is an extremely simple
one. Was Edwin Drood killed? If so, was Jasper the murderer? The defence has
made one amazing, and I think fatal admission. It admits that John Jasper attacked Drood,
attacked him with the intention of murdering him, and by that admission it consents
that John Jasper’s character has gone—that he is a monster, that he is a hypocrite, that
he is a man of no moral pretension, that he is a scheming criminal, and that murder was
actually in his heart. A stranger defence could scarcely be conceived, and yet there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
something in it, because it tries to ride off upon a side issue, and says that “Whereas
you may convict this man of a certain attempt, we say that half way there he failed.”
It is our duty, therefore, to try to prove to you that this man must inevitably have
succeeded, and that he knew he had succeeded, and acted as if he had. What are the
facts that demonstrated to you most conclusively that John Jasper committed the
murder, and that Edwin Drood could not escape? Our contention is that he was the
victim of a most carefully and elaborately prepared plot, carried out systematically,
arranged most carefully, of such a character that there was no loophole by which he
could possibly escape. John Jasper interviewed the right people, chose the exact spot,
arranged the very hour when he would have all his material together for the completing
of that dreadful task to which he had given himself. He had decided that his rival must
be removed—that secret rival who was between him and the great passion, the all-absorbing
passion of his life; having once made up his mind, he was inexorable. He
knew nothing whatever of pity; he was a complete criminal; and all his acts show that
his crime was carried out with a sort of hideous triumph.</p>

<p>But you are asked to believe that he failed, after making all these arrangements, and
failed because he was dazed by opium, and only dreamed of the particular act which he
thought he had committed. First remember the nature of the attack—the double nature
of the attack. It included strangling with a silk scarf, and that was to be followed by the
use of quicklime. If Drood escaped the one, surely it was nothing short of a miracle
that he escaped the other? And, in any case, if he escaped why should he obligingly
disappear to the convenience of the man who attacked him, and to the very great inconvenience
of all the friends who loved him? John Jasper was a lasting danger to all
who remained behind. Edwin Drood could not so entirely disappear from the realms of
civilisation that he would not possibly know what was going on in Cloisterham, and yet
you are asked to believe, Gentlemen, that this man upon whom a murderous attack had
been made, went away at a convenient moment, leaving his friends to the persecution
of the man who had assailed him, and leaving the way clear for the assailant to pursue
his own evil courses! I should say it is almost inconceivable—or I should if my learned
friend had not so ingeniously conceived it; but that it is believable I don’t think you
will for a moment agree.</p>

<p>And what definite evidence has been produced to show that Jasper, who had arranged
all this for a definite period—Christmas Eve—was suffering from opium at about that
time? You have the evidence of Canon Crisparkle that on the very morning of that day,
when he met him, he was in wonderfully fine voice, clear-headed, cheerful, in a good
temper. All this is absolutely proved by the direct and unimpeached testimony of Canon
Crisparkle. Where are the traces of opium? There are no traces of opium. The supreme
moment had come, and Jasper was supremely ready for it. There were no traces of opium
on him when those two young men departed from his home. He could not have soaked
himself in opium during their short absence, and then have recovered in time to make
his accusation against Neville Landless by the morning. But you are asked to believe
that in that short interval he had time to recover—that he was in a trance so deep that
he really thought he had committed a murder which he had not, and yet, early the next
morning was so clear-headed, so resolute in purpose, so ready with a connected story
which would fix the crime on another person. And why should he have been eager to
give the alarm if he had the slightest doubt? A man risen from a trance of opium might
have some doubts: but he had none, and within a few hours he was setting things in
motion himself, giving the alarm. He had Neville called back, a course he had decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
on from the first; he was going to fix the crime on Neville Landless; and within those
few hours he had carefully and deliberately carried out the entire scheme. Why this
immediate suggestion of murder? Why not a little lapse of time? Because he was
confident that the murder had been committed and that the body would not be recovered;
and therefore he could be resolute and speedy in his actions, and proceed at
once to the second part of the crime which had been the motive for the original crime.</p>

<p>What did he do? Not only did he pursue Neville Landless remorselessly, but he
set about persecuting Rosa Bud, whom he could afford to threaten, because he was
aware it was safe—that the one rival who had been in his path had been swept out of
his way, and that his way was clear. Does a man dazed with opium act in this decisive,
rational fashion? He carefully robbed the corpse of those particular jewels of which
he had an inventory. My learned friend makes the point—Why did he not feel in his
pockets? Why did he not do this, that, and the other? He had inquired of Durdles
what quicklime would do. He knew that it would not destroy metal. He had told a
jeweller in Cloisterham that he knew exactly what jewellery Edwin had. It consisted of
the watch and chain and the scarf pin. It was exactly those things which disappeared
and were found in the weir by Canon Crisparkle. What a curious coincidence that the
very three things he had an inventory of, and no more, should disappear! And why did
he not seek further? Coppers and buttons are no means of certain identification; he
could afford to ignore them. Moreover, a murderer does not linger about the body of
his victim; besides, he was already convinced that having removed those three items
of jewellery, by which Drood could be identified, he was secure, and the quicklime would
do the rest; then he hastened back, for he had to get home again in order to be prepared
for the morning, to make his charge against Neville Landless.</p>

<p>But there was one article about Edwin Drood’s person of which Jasper knew nothing—the
ring, which Drood was to return if his betrothal was broken off, but which we
say Grewgious never received. That ring would hold the murderer, and bring him to
his doom. It would not be destroyed by the quicklime, and would be there intact and
the means of bringing him to the scene of his desperate crime. Remember, he courted
inquiry immediately after Drood’s disappearance—a sign of his supreme confidence
and his colossal audacity. The man who has the slightest doubt that the murder may
not have been completed does not at once set the law into motion, go to the magistrate
and bring a charge. But if he knows it is completed and the body has gone, he can afford
to do so. Everything he had designed to do, he did. It was only something that he did not
know of which caused him to bungle. He was not by nature a bungler. He was one of
the completest types of criminals that you can imagine, a man who for months and
months had been meditating on the closest details of the crime—been to the crypt,
talked with Durdles, spoke to Mr. Crisparkle, started his theory that Neville Landless
was the person to be charged—and a man who does all those things cannot be accurately
described as a bungler.</p>

<p>Canon Crisparkle told you the part Jasper played in fomenting quarrels between
Drood and Landless. It is exactly the course that a calculating murderer would pursue.
And you have heard the evidence of Durdles, a man who probably scarcely understood
the purport of his own remarks. How valuable his testimony was! Jasper had spoken
to him of quicklime and of tombs, and Jasper had gone with him on a midnight expedition.
Was all this vain and useless? Was the expedition at midnight merely a pleasant little
picnic for no particular purpose, or merely for fun? Not for fun, when we find that it
all fits the composite scheme of murder which was carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>My learned friend has spoken about Helena Landless. I say she is a witness entirely
beyond reproach. She was the very woman framed by nature to carry out her arduous
part. She had every need for her action and the capacity for her daring work—every
essential qualification for that difficult part was possessed in advance by Helena Landless.
She had had experience; in her youth she had dressed as a boy, and shown the daring
of a man; she was the leader of her brother, and when everything else had failed, when
six months had passed by and she was able to do nothing by ordinary means, she adopted
this extraordinary means of disguise in order to carry out her work. We are asked why
she did not paint her face. I don’t know whether my learned friend wanted her to black
her face or what he wanted her to do; but she was brought up in a warm climate with
a rich dark complexion and she chose the part of the “old buffer,” which means, if
it means anything, something of the sailor type. Her complexion was ready for her.
She wore a large white wig to hide her luxuriant tresses. Why Bazzard should wear a
large wig I don’t know. She had the only effective disguise for her, the disguise of an
elderly man, because she had to live up to the white wig to conceal her woman’s figure.
She was no stranger in Cloisterham and was perfectly equal to the task of conversing
with those whom she had already met before.</p>

<p>One word on Bazzard. If you reject Helena Landless, there is only one alternative.
You must put Thomas Bazzard in her place. Is this Mr. Bazzard, the man who fell asleep
while his employer was discussing crucial matters with a client, one who was likely to
appear as the elderly Mr. Datchery in Cloisterham? This man, who thinks more of his
drama than his law work, is he a likely man to have devoted himself to confronting a man
already suspected of murder? You have seen a Mr. Bazzard in the box, and I put it
to you that he was specially got up to produce a false impression upon you. The Bazzard
in the box was bright and alert and voluble. The official record says that he was “a pale,
puffy-faced, dark-haired person of thirty, with big dark eyes that wholly wanted lustre,
and a dissatisfied, doughy complexion that seemed to ask to be sent to the baker’s.”
That is the gentleman who was to act the part of the brave and daring Datchery! I say
it is impossible, and that his own vanity has tempted him to claim these honours. He
told you he “placed” the ring in the crypt for any passer-by to pick up, and that, knowing
Drood was alive, he still allowed Neville Landless to be accused of murder and Rosa Bud
to be persecuted by Jasper. This from a man connected with law! It is an absurd story,
and utterly incredible. I ask you to reject it.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, a solemn duty rests on you in this crisis which I am sure gentlemen of
your ability and intelligence will faithfully discharge. It is with infinite pain that I have
to ask that this man shall pay the penalty of his sin. But John Jasper himself showed no
mercy. He fondled the victim whom he intended to butcher; he lured to his doom one
who he had made to feel was his nearest and dearest friend; he destroyed a life full of
promise, a life which might have been fruitful and happy. I do not ask for vengeance,
but only for the fulfilment of the law, that justice may be trusted to maintain the sanctity
of human life. If you fail in your duty this man will henceforth be free. I charge you,
in the name of humanity and human rights, to quit you as men, to act on the facts
which have been placed before you. This mystery, Gentlemen, has lasted long enough.
It is in your power to-day to elucidate what has seemed to be obscure, to solve this deep
and complex problem. Yours is an enviable opportunity, and to-day you may strike a
very great blow for the truth. The eyes of the nation are upon you, the whole world is
anxiously awaiting your decision. I beg you, Gentlemen, resolutely and earnestly to
sweep away all this fantasy which has been placed before you by my learned friend, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
forget his extraordinary story of a half murder, which I think I have shown to be
impossible, and by one bold and emphatic stroke to solve for ever the Mystery of
Edwin Drood.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">The Summing Up.</span>]</p>

<p>His Lordship then proceeded to sum up, as follows:</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Jury</span>—</p>

<p>You will not be the first Jury empanelled in this great country who will have to
come to your decision with unreasonable speed. The proceedings have been so
interesting that I cannot hope to do them justice; but I will merely go over, as far as
I can, the main features of the case, and then my duty will be to leave it to you. First
of all, it should be remembered, because it is indeed included in what is referred to
as the Official Record——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Spectator</span>: Louder, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: I am speaking to the Jury. If you think you can hang that man for us, you
are mistaken.—I say it is included even in the Official Record by an indirect admission
that we owe a great deal of information that we have heard this evening to a man of
letters. I must therefore ask the Gentlemen of the Jury to put themselves for one moment
in the position of such a person. You must forget that you are solid and good citizens
summoned to decide a serious matter, nay, I must forget that I am an experienced
Judge seated on this Bench for many years; and we must all try to think—both the Jury
and myself—try to think we are authors. Supposing that to be the case, it is all the easier,
of course, to imagine oneself the author of a crime. I will, therefore, very rapidly divide
up the evidence, as I see it, on the two sides, and then leave the matter to you.</p>

<p>I need not tell you how serious is the issue put before you. If it were only the
solemnity of ending the Mystery of Edwin Drood it would be almost as solemn as that
of ending a human life, but if any doubt exists in your minds at all as to whether the
Mystery of Edwin Drood has been solved by the prosecution, you must permit the
prisoner in the dock to go forth, even if from a merely personal study of his countenance
you think he is going forth to murder other people. Unless the prosecution has convinced
you that the Mystery is at an end, you have no right to convict him, and he has
the right to the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p>The next thing necessary clearly to distinguish is the evidence of the two principal
witnesses. The others were rather entertainers than witnesses. There were two very
genuine witnesses, one of whom perjured himself or herself—that is to say, would have
done so had we permitted profanity to enter into these proceedings. I want to say one
thing about that. It is a remarkable fact, and in that point the Jury ought to really fairly
balance their minds, because there is a case for possible perjury in both instances. So
horrible a crime as perjury can only be committed either from a very low or a very high
motive. The character of Mr. Bazzard, as revealed by himself with picturesque clearness,
appears to me an entertaining and attractive but, shall I say? not a saintly character,
and it appears to me to be arguable that he might possibly tell a lie from general amusement
at the absurd way in which the world is run. On the other hand, it is admitted,
I think, for Miss Landless that though she would not tell a lie or forswear herself for
money, she might conceivably do it as counting religious observance beneath some
affection she had for her brother. I therefore put it to the Jury as possible that both are
liars. But I should distinguish between their motives if I were writing a spiritual treatise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
It is tenable in both cases. Undoubtedly if one is telling the truth the other is lying.</p>

<p>About the wearing of a wig, I think the point has been somewhat unduly pressed
on one side. I think it is a strong argument for Datchery being Helena Landless, but
not a very strong one that she feels the weight of the wig. I suppose there are many of
us here this evening who have been not unconscious of the discomfort of wearing a wig
when you have too much hair already. So I should not press forward the argument that
it must have been a woman’s hair—or I should not press it too far. Edwin Drood is
represented in the picture as having monstrously long hair—but that does not concern
us here. I think it should be conceded as a point, but not a very great point, to the
prosecution. We come to the second broad distinction which amounts to this: that
very few of the witnesses, and I daresay very few of the Jurymen, are acquainted with
the proper use and enjoyment of two substances, one of which is opium, and the other
quicklime. Most of us, I conceive, indulge in these things, if at all, in great moderation,
but anyhow, a great deal depends upon the operation of these two things; and it appears
to me on that point that the whole of this Court, not having called any expert evidence,
either of morphia maniacs, or of persons partially buried in quicklime, (who are, I imagine
a select class)—as the trial has not called any kind of technical evidence about the effects
of these things, I think it my duty to put it to the Jury that they must reserve their judgment
and allow a wide space for human ignorance about the effects of these things.
I certainly do not know how quick opium confuses the mind, or how quick quicklime
destroys the body, and if the Jury know it, I, in the best traditions of the Bench and Bar,
command that they dismiss it from their minds.</p>

<p>We have placed in front of us two allegations. On the one side it is alleged by the
prosecution that there is, after all is said and done, a very strong argument for the death
of Drood, in the fact that he did not return; it is alleged by the defence that you have
an even stronger argument against any theory of the murder of Edwin Drood, because,
again, he did not return, even as a corpse. “If he is dead,” says the defence, “where
is the corpse?” “If he is alive,” says the prosecution, “where is he?” That, I think,
is a fair summary of the arguments, and it is obvious that if you come to think it out,
these two theories depend on those two suppositions. Is it possible for opium to make
a person half commit a murder? or Is it possible for quicklime so to destroy all traces,
including buttons, and so that the disappearance of the body is evidence of the murder?
That is the question I shall leave entirely to you—as to whether there is enough of what
I may truly call “quicklime evidence” to warrant you regarding Jasper as a real murderer,
or enough of “opium evidence” to warrant you saying that it was a visionary or dream
murder. Those, I should say, would be the broad lines on which you have to decide.
For the rest, you have to be answerable to the highest conceivable Authority as to how
you deal with a very fascinating romance. Gentlemen of the Jury, you will retire and
consider your verdict.</p>


<p class="center no-indent">[<span class="smcap">The Verdict.</span>]</p>

<p>Immediately his Lordship had concluded, the Foreman of the Jury rose and said:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,—I am happy to be able to announce to your Lordship that we, following
the tradition and practice of British Juries, have arranged our verdict in the luncheon
interval. I should explain, my Lord, that it undoubtedly presented itself to us as a point
of extraordinary difficulty in this case, that a man should disappear absolutely and
completely, having cut off all communication with his friends in Cloisterham; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
having seen and heard the society and conversation of Cloisterham here in Court to-day,
we no longer feel the slightest surprise at that. Now, under the influence of that observation,
my Lord, the more extreme characters, if they will allow me to say so, in this
Jury, were at first inclined to find a verdict of Not Guilty, because there was no evidence
of a murder having been committed; but on the other hand, the calmer and more
judicious spirits among us felt that to allow a man who had committed a cold-blooded
murder of which his own nephew was the victim, to leave the dock absolutely unpunished,
was a proceeding which would probably lead to our all being murdered in
our beds. And so you will be glad to learn that the spirit of compromise and moderation
prevailed, and we find the prisoner guilty of Manslaughter.</p>

<p>We recommend him most earnestly to your Lordship’s mercy, whilst at the same
time begging your Lordship to remember that the protection of the lives of the community
is in your hands, and begging you not to allow any sentimental consideration
to deter you from applying the law in its utmost vigour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span>: I should like to urge that the Jury be discharged for not having
performed their duties in the proper spirit of the law. We have heard from the Foreman
that the verdict was arranged in advance, and I decline to accept that verdict, and ask
for your Lordship’s ruling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Foreman</span>: The Jury, like all British Juries, will be only too delighted to be
discharged at the earliest moment: the sooner the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Chesterton</span>: I want to associate myself with my learned friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge</span>: My decision is that everybody here, except myself, be committed for
Contempt of Court. Off you all go to prison without any trial whatever!</p>

<p>The Court rose at 11.35, the actual hearing having occupied four hours and twenty
minutes.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
